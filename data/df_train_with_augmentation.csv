2,2,"work really good , is very light and good",0,6,0,0,2
3,3,great laptop for the price .,3,6,2,5,7
4,4,very fast for what i use it for .,3,6,2,5,7
5,5,only downfall is that it doesn ’ t have an internal dvdcd drive .,3,6,2,5,7
6,6,does come with norton security that i recommend immediately changing .,3,6,2,5,7
7,7,norton didn ’ t load 6 or the first 12 times i turned the computer on .,3,6,2,5,7
8,8,since it is new and windows updates regularly it will take several hours to update right out of the box .,3,6,2,5,7
9,9,"i just got this today , but i pretty much tell right out of the box that this is going to do exactly what i need it to accomplish .",2,2,2,1,7
10,10,"first of all , i 'm a freelance writer and photographer , so i will be heavily using microsoft office , gimp , , and spotify .",2,2,2,1,7
11,11,here are my first impressions ( i 'll update this review as needed )  i was able to load everything very quickly .,2,2,2,1,7
12,12,"it seems like the processor is going to do the job well.i 've had no problem multitasking thanks to the ssd and 8gb 's ultra lightweight , which is good because i already have a camera body and a few lenses in my 14-inch 1080p screen is way better than the standard def 15.6-inch screen on my old built-in sd",2,2,2,1,7
13,13,"that having been said , it 's a simple and cost-effective way to keep running my business as i travel the world ( which is the whole point of my business ) .",2,2,2,1,7
14,14,"i recommend this laptop for freelance writers and photographers , but the shared video ram is a no-no for video editing or heavy gaming .",2,2,2,1,7
15,15,got it for an acquittance .,2,2,2,1,7
16,16,"so far working great , a bit worried as an early adopter that it does n't show up at asus official website .",2,2,2,1,7
17,17,"upgrading ( actually , replacing ) from an asus from 2012 ( 6 years old , that i also recommended , same price ) that started to fail .",2,2,2,1,7
18,18,the difference in speedpower is awesome .,2,2,2,1,7
19,19,"the power adapter is very tiny ( i also have a thin asus zenbook with a compatible adapter that is about 150 % the size of this one ) , even more compared to the power brick from before .",2,2,2,1,7
20,20,the owner is hyper will last another years !,2,2,2,1,7
21,21,it ’ s loud .,2,2,2,1,7
22,22,not sure why but all i hear is this thing thinking and the noise comes from the speakers on the top .,2,2,2,1,7
23,23,aside from this it ’ s built poorly .,2,2,2,1,7
24,24,be very careful with it it ’ s very lightweight and as a result i think it ’ s made from foam .,2,2,2,1,7
25,25,"it is pretty fast so if your willing to wear earplugs and never move with it , it should get done what you need it too .",2,2,2,1,7
26,26,first new laptop in years .,2,2,2,1,7
27,27,needed something for travel and when i do n't want to sit at the desktop .,2,2,2,1,7
28,28,"wanted to try solid state drive , not disappointed .",2,2,2,1,7
29,29,very fast startup .,2,2,2,1,7
30,30,do n't see any delay running programs or video .,2,2,2,1,7
31,31,windows uses about 50g of your drive space .,2,2,2,1,7
32,32,no problem with sound or noise .,2,2,2,1,7
33,33,light but not flimsy .,2,2,2,1,7
34,34,about 6 hrs on battery .,2,2,2,1,7
35,35,"runs cool , no hot spots that i 've noticed .",2,2,2,1,7
36,36,wifi is just 2.4 -- no 5g .,2,2,2,1,7
37,37,even my very old laptop supported 5g - come on guys .,2,2,2,1,7
38,38,"this is n't really a problem though as most web page downloads are n't a factor of your wifi , it 's a factor of all the ads and how fast the sender is transmitting it .",2,2,2,1,7
39,39,i have 70 mbps on my desktop and still wait for all the ads .,2,2,2,1,7
40,40,"overall , quite happy .",2,2,2,1,7
41,41,"and for the price , very happy .",2,2,2,1,7
42,42,have the 15.6 inch version .,3,0,2,1,3
43,43,it is extremely light and has a beautiful high-resolution screen .,3,0,2,1,3
44,44,i have not noticed any screen glare ( as one reviewer mentioned ) ; i guess it depends on where you place the light .,3,0,2,1,3
45,45,"it is very , but not too .",3,0,2,1,3
46,46,no cddvd drive .,3,0,2,1,3
47,47,that was necessary to keep the weight down .,3,0,2,1,3
48,48,one can always use an external .,3,0,2,1,3
49,49,there is no usb 2 port .,3,0,2,1,3
50,50,"this probably won ’ t matter to most users , but when i try to install the driver for my hp laserjet , it tells me that the printer can not connect to a usb 3 documentation is lacking some information .",3,0,2,1,3
51,51,"there are symbols on the function keys that i can ’ t figure out , and the meanings are not included in the method to boot from a usb flash drive is not described .",3,0,2,1,3
52,52,"i looked on line , and there is apparently a convoluted way to do it .",3,0,2,1,3
53,53,i need this because i do regular image backups of my c drive to a usb drive .,3,0,2,1,3
54,54,"the backup software ( ) makes a sector-by-sector backup of the entire c drive , including the operating system .",3,0,2,1,3
55,55,"if something goes wrong , i can restore the entire c drive to an earlier version .",3,0,2,1,3
56,56,it even protects me from ransomware .,3,0,2,1,3
57,57,"to do a restore , i have to boot from a usb flash drive to a program that does the restore .",3,0,2,1,3
58,58,my desktop has an asus motherboard .,3,0,2,1,3
59,59,"when i turn it on , if i press the del key , it takes me to the bios screen , where i can choose where to boot from .",3,0,2,1,3
60,60,it would be nice if the lg offered such a simple method .,3,0,2,1,3
61,61,i know this is of little interest to most users .,3,0,2,1,3
62,62,"having gone through multiple tablets and macs , i settled on the lg gram 15 '' - it 's been two days and the it 's lived up to the hype after watching scores of youtube videos and reading reviews both on amazon and other review sites .",3,0,2,1,3
63,63,"the magnesium chassis has a good rugged feel and is cold to the keyboard is pretty awesome , i 've owned thinkpads and other corporate laptops -- the lg gram keyboard is great to type precision trackpad means great support for windows slots means i 'm not locked to 256gb forever and there is room for upgrades charging",3,0,2,1,3
64,64,pros  - compatible with  - awful screen off-center keyboard due to num pad thoughts  - keys feel about right for a laptop ( not too mushy ) - touchpad is texture makes the laptop feel like it was made out of cheap plastic -- with about every device was recognized out of the box,3,0,2,1,3
65,65,special modifications or external modules were unnecessary .,3,0,2,1,3
66,66,my previous laptop was a 2013 macbook air .,3,0,2,1,3
67,67,"suspend and resume work , acpi lid events are sensible and not noisy ( on the macbook , i had them just turned off ) . -- screen 've almost always used my macbook air with a matte screen protector , but the difference is .",3,0,2,1,3
68,68,i do n't understand why lg offered no options in the 2018 line up with a matte display .,3,0,2,1,3
69,69,i think one of the reasons it feels even worse is because black reproduction is so good on the laptop .,3,0,2,1,3
70,70,"as a result , more of the glare is visible .",3,0,2,1,3
71,71,"hopefully , a matte screen protector will solve this issue , though , i 'm not able to find good ones at this time.it 's a really good display that could be much improved with a matte screen. -- is by no means a major flaw , but who even benefits from this .",3,0,2,1,3
72,72,it 's a unnecessary inconvenience .,3,0,2,1,3
73,73,the experience would be better without those extra unnecessary keys .,3,0,2,1,3
74,74,by far the lightest laptop i owned .,3,0,2,1,3
75,75,super fast start-up .,3,0,2,1,3
76,76,extremely pleased with this one !,3,0,2,1,3
77,77,honestly the form factor was really nice and thin and light but the computer itself was laggy,3,0,2,1,3
78,78,could not get over the weird concave bend in the metal chassis the keyboard sits in .,3,0,2,1,3
79,79,lg told me this is normal but it looks like a defect in the assembly .,3,0,2,1,3
80,80,"i can not tell for sure if it is defect or design , but i do n't want to risk it.not sure why the flat metal area around the keyboard and below the screen would need to be bent downward in such a way .",3,0,2,1,3
81,81,"( to describe it one way , it looked a little like what you would expect your laptop keyboard to look like if someone sat on it .",3,0,2,1,3
82,82,) the metal top should be flat front to back and not curved at the back of or behind the very nice packaging & nice looking machine .,3,0,2,1,3
83,83,if it was n't for the weird curved area around the top for the keyboard it would have been a keeper .,3,0,2,1,3
84,84,very light .,3,0,2,1,3
85,85,battery life is far off what they claim it to be .,3,0,2,1,3
86,86,i had it set at 40 % and was streaming about 5 12 hours over 2 days and it was down to 10 % .,3,0,2,1,3
87,87,ordering a replacement and trying another .,3,0,2,1,3
88,88,i 'll leave an update .,3,0,2,1,3
89,89,this computer is amazingly light .,3,0,2,1,3
90,90,"honestly i was shocked the first time i picked it up , it 's that light .",3,0,2,1,3
91,91,it 's amazing that they can fit such a well performing large screened laptop and have it be this light .,3,0,2,1,3
92,92,the screen is beautiful .,3,0,2,1,3
93,93,hardly any bezels too so it 's pretty much all screen .,3,0,2,1,3
94,94,"the keyboard is nice and comfortable with a nice , not mushy like others .",3,0,2,1,3
95,95,the trackpad is very responsive .,3,0,2,1,3
96,96,"just as good as any other laptop i have used , including macs .",3,0,2,1,3
97,97,the specs are spot on for probably 90 % of people .,3,0,2,1,3
98,98,the 8th gen i5 is the brand new 2018 processor and it 's fast !,3,0,2,1,3
99,99,8 gig of ram is more than enough for your average user .,3,0,2,1,3
100,100,"256gb ssd hard drive is fast and a good size , i would say it 's more than enough space for the normal casual user .",3,0,2,1,3
101,101,tons of ports including the most current .,3,0,2,1,3
102,102,while i have not run any `` tests '' on the battery life it seems pretty insane .,3,0,2,1,3
103,103,lg quotes 19 hours and i have been getting that and a little more even .,3,0,2,1,3
104,104,it 's nice to be able to not have `` plug anxiety '' and always have to worry about being near a plug for power .,3,0,2,1,3
105,105,so far this laptop has powered through literally everything i have thrown at it .,3,0,2,1,3
106,106,"i installed office 2016 and it handles excel , word , powerpoint , etc .",3,0,2,1,3
107,107,with ease .,3,0,2,1,3
108,108,i typically have a lot of tabs open while i 'm browsing and it has never slowed down .,3,0,2,1,3
109,109,i love watching netflix on the large high def screen .,3,0,2,1,3
110,110,overall a super laptop for a great price that will meet the needs of 90 % of users .,3,0,2,1,3
111,111,highly recommended !,3,0,2,1,3
112,112,"first off , this thing is the lightest laptop i have ever owned or 's start by the '' full hd ips lcd screen .",3,0,2,1,3
113,113,very thin edges 10 home .,3,0,2,1,3
114,114,fair lithium battery ( up to 19 - 2014 standard ) .,3,0,2,1,3
115,115,"yes , that is about right .",3,0,2,1,3
116,116,what i can guarantee is that i only keep it plugged just the time to recharge it to 100 % and then it last me a good week of random use unplugged .,3,0,2,1,3
117,117,i have set it up so it goes in sleep mode when not in use for more than 15mn unplugged and that it turn off the screen after 8th generation cpu .,3,0,2,1,3
118,118,maybe but speed is fairly ram & 256gb ssd .,3,0,2,1,3
119,119,one should add m2 ssd in installed a benchmark tool similar to the win 4 performance tool and here is the score i got 7.3 out of gaming graphics gets the max processor and ram get a solid 9.0 out of hard disk gets a 8.2 out of downer is the graphic performance ( aero i guess ),3,0,2,1,3
120,120,"at 2.4 lbs for a 15.6 '' laptop , this is the battery life  for once a laptop that could allow me a full in-flight use while flying to the screen quality  ips screen .",3,0,2,1,3
121,121,i have not seen the response time for gaming but ips is usually modulable  i have already opened it to install another m2 ssd drive of 500gb .,3,0,2,1,3
122,122,it was fairly .,3,0,2,1,3
123,123,i unscrewed the backplate ( 9 screws ) and that was pretty much all it micro sd 3 usb 3.0 one hdmi one headphone jack plug ( not one for mic and one for headset ) very good sound very nice quality of silent .,3,0,2,1,3
124,124,"even with the processor at 100 % speed , the noise level remained very low ) what i like less  - i have not found the second port for additional ram .",3,0,2,1,3
125,125,so one may need to replace the 8gb by 16gb .,3,0,2,1,3
126,126,"this may be conclusion  i was previously using a 11 '' laptop to carry around and i decided to use this new one because it is lighter , more powerful and has a better battery life .",3,0,2,1,3
127,127,"no regrets at for gaming , i usually use my very powerful desktop so i have not had the chance to really do internet browsing , excel work and likes , this works very solid 5 stars have eventually replaced the ssd drive to a samsung 950 pro 256gb and added a wd black 500gb as second drive .",3,0,2,1,3
128,128,it is worth noting that both are m2 pcie m key and both did fit .,3,0,2,1,3
129,129,the original hd was a should be aware that one m2 port is pcie gen 3x2 and the other is a pcie gen 3x4 .,3,0,2,1,3
130,130,"if you swap from to m key , the main driver is the empty slot .",3,0,2,1,3
131,131,"in clear , if you upgrade your drive , put the new drive into the empty slot , it will be the , the difference is not that dramatic but you will get the following  - about 2gb write for the main about 800 mb write for the main now , my performance index for the",3,0,2,1,3
132,132,much faster boot speed and disk access in general .,3,0,2,1,3

134,134,"this is a great laptop , it is functional for what i need for business .",3,1,0,4,5
135,135,i did n't need something that was uber powerful .,3,1,0,4,5
136,136,"however working in the broadcast business as an engineer , the 4gb ram is not enough for this machine .",3,1,0,4,5
137,137,it is practically unusable due to the fact that it is extremely slow .,3,1,0,4,5
138,138,"i have over-clocked the processor , because it was only running at 600 mhz .",3,1,0,4,5
139,139,"it still ran way to slow , i 'm pretty sure a tortoise passed me up .",3,1,0,4,5
140,140,i will update this rating once i get some more ram installed .,3,1,0,4,5
141,141,i plan on running it at the full capacity of 16gb ram .,3,1,0,4,5
142,142,time will tell .,3,1,0,4,5
143,143,i debated with myself over the screen size ; how small a screen could i live with ,3,1,0,0,2
144,144,i also wanted it to be as light as possible .,3,1,0,0,2
145,145,"i opted for a larger screen , but i find that it 's heavier than i wanted for my carry-around laptop so i could leave my bigger and very expensive macbook pro at home .",3,1,0,0,2
146,146,"in hindsight , i think i could live with a smaller screen , perhaps 12 '' also debated about the ram and disk size .",3,1,0,0,2
147,147,disk size is actually far less important on a chromebook than it is on a mac or pc .,3,1,0,0,2

152,152,you do n't even have to look at how much space is available on disk .,3,1,0,0,2
153,153,"i opted for 4gb ram rather than 2gb , because the unit was still around $ 200 .",3,1,0,0,2

170,170,running through the usb port the operating system is as snappy as the native chrome os .,3,1,0,0,2
171,171,there very occasional moments of lag that last 5-8 seconds but i think it 's still faster than a laptop using hdd .,3,1,0,0,2

181,181,it seems comparable to the battery life of a macbook pro i used to have .,3,1,0,0,2
182,182,"i 've got a samsung 11 inch chromebook that has amazing battery life , but i do n't like using it because the screen is too small .",3,1,0,0,2

380,380,"great performance for the price , i 'd even say this is the best bang-for-your-buck gaming laptop in the market , however , by no means this machine feels cheap .",3,2,2,4,0
381,381,"while it does n't posses rgb , or a 144 hz monitor , it 's solidly constructed and feels premium though and only slight annoyance is that the fan can be quite loud at times , but that 's not enough to make me deduce a star .",3,2,2,4,0
382,382,i thoroughly recommend this laptop .,3,2,2,4,0

388,388,"only con is that it requires constant power to actually play games at decent framerates , which is understandable considering the 1060 is almost on par with the desktop variant but it defeats the purpose of a portable gaming laptop .",3,2,2,4,0
389,389,"sleek design does collect finger prints rather easily , and they ’ re very hard to get rid of .",3,2,2,4,0

420,420,"it 's lonely at a distant hotel , so i needed something to play my video games on while monitoring .",3,2,2,4,0
421,421,i did n't do as much studying and researching as i normally would on a purchase like this .,3,2,2,4,0
422,422,i have a fairly good grasp and knowledge of computer parts and what i need and do n't screen was important but not a deal-breaker since the hotel is a courtyard and has hdmi televisions that i could connect to .,3,2,2,4,0
423,423,the screen is very nice and i could only see the most stringent of display snobs having a problem with it .,3,2,2,4,0

427,427,"i have a bose revolve and take it with me , it connects easily to the laptop 's i bought this there seemed to be some questions about the specs , so i 've made a short list of the ones i was most interested in  it has the nvidia geforce 1060 6gb video card , it plays everything i play",3,2,2,4,0
428,428,"i 'll go more into that has bluetooth as mentioned above , and ac wifi , both work very good.the battery life is good for me but i never have it unplugged for more than an hour to two hours .",3,2,2,4,0
429,429,i guess i could have tested that but i rarely think about unplugging it.the keyboard is so nice that i actually use it instead of plugging a usb keyboard in but i did buy the logitech smaller wireless keyboard ( logitech ) and mouse set just to be safe .,3,2,2,4,0
430,430,trackpad works well too but i prefer a mouse .,3,2,2,4,0
431,431,do n't hold that against the laptop .,3,2,2,4,0
432,432,i 've used a laptop maybe 1 year total in my life and have used a desktop pc for more than 20 .,3,2,2,4,0
433,433,i 'm just not that used to the trackpad .,3,2,2,4,0
434,434,"the keyboard and trackpad are backlit with a red color , it 's non-offensive and and helps a lot if you like to use it in the has a solid state drive that had around 80 gb of free space upon booting it the first time .",3,2,2,4,0
435,435,it 's used for your windows which gives you a fast bootup .,3,2,2,4,0
436,436,it also has a hard disc drive that has 920 gb of free space upon booting it the first time .,3,2,2,4,0
437,437,"it takes less than 10 seconds for me to go from pushing the power button , signing in to being on the desktop .",3,2,2,4,0
438,438,"that 's very comparable to my high-end desktop 's an hdmi , a thunderbolt and three more 3.1 usb ( those work with the older usb versions , if wondering ) has 8 gb of ram , it can be upgraded to 32 gb and is very simple to upgrade if you need more laptop either met every need",3,2,2,4,0
439,439,the video card is a bonus to me .,3,2,2,4,0
440,440,i do n't play the newest games and usually prefer console versions .,3,2,2,4,0
441,441,i will say i can play morrowind with graphics overhaul with no problem on this laptop .,3,2,2,4,0
442,442,i also can play fallout 4 on it with no problems .,3,2,2,4,0
443,443,"and what i 've been mainly doing is using it to play games through ps now , it runs those perfectly .",3,2,2,4,0
444,444,"i do n't get any of the noise , i 'm guessing i 'm not pushing the card that hard but will say it 's very comparable to my pc at home that has a geforce 980 gtx in it .",3,2,2,4,0
445,445,and i 'm again guessing that 's because these games i play are n't very stressful on the gpu .,3,2,2,4,0
446,446,"the 980 gtx is rated quite a bit better in benchmark tests but take it from me , unless you 're playing the very newest games on ultra settings , you 're not going to notice .",3,2,2,4,0
447,447,i spent 3 months buying that pc with the 980 gtx and can say i do n't think i 've ever come close to using all the power it makes this a great `` work '' computer !,3,2,2,4,0
448,448,i do use a few programs for work that this laptop handles easily .,3,2,2,4,0
449,449,i 'll also mention that there was n't much bloatware on it .,3,2,2,4,0
450,450,"and by the way , cortana is not disabled when you first setup the laptop so be aware .",3,2,2,4,0
451,451,"i plugged it in and turned it on , went to the bathroom , came out and heard someone talking .",3,2,2,4,0
452,452,it was cortana .,3,2,2,4,0
453,453,i 'm also one of the people who really likes windows 10 and it works well on this ca n't find a single fault with it .,3,2,2,4,0
454,454,unless i wanted to complain about the sound but what do you expect from a laptop ,3,2,2,4,0
455,455,i would normally say whether it 's overpowered for some people or underpowered for others but i think those looking at it are probably like me and thinking about some gaming use .,3,2,2,4,0
456,456,"i will upgrade the ram eventually , probably in summer but it 's really not needed yet .",3,2,2,4,0
457,457,"all in all , i think for the price , the video card , the good dual hard drive format , it 's about as good as you can ask at that , i forgot to mention it does n't have a drive .",3,2,2,4,0
458,458,i really planned it that way since i did n't even notice it until a few weeks of using it .,3,2,2,4,0
459,459,"that might be a downside to some , so make note of that .",3,2,2,4,0
460,460,i have a usb disc drive if i need to use a disc but have n't in at least a year .,3,2,2,4,0
461,461,"and guess i should mention that it 's well-built , might be a hair heavy for some .",3,2,2,4,0
462,462,my daughter used it one day and said it felt like a triple version of her laptop .,3,2,2,4,0
463,463,dell did a nice job with this laptop .,3,2,2,4,0
464,464,it is able to run games that require gtx 1060 6gb pretty smoothly .,3,2,2,4,0
465,465,the one thing that ticks me off is that it gives me a white screen with lines when i open it 30 % of the time .,3,2,2,4,0
466,466,its an easy fix by just holding down the power button and turning it on again .,3,2,2,4,0
467,467,other than that its a fast boi !,3,2,2,4,0
468,468,i bought it when it was on sale for about $ 897 so that made it even more worth it .,3,2,2,4,0

511,511,i have to knock off a star for two points though .,3,2,2,4,0
512,512,it 's a little too big .,3,2,2,4,0

577,577,"nope , but i wanted something i can use when i 'm away from my desktop gaming wise , it 's not bad , a gtx 1060 with 6gb of vram , that alone is something to consider as i looked around there is n't anything at this price point with this gpu power .",3,2,2,4,0

597,597,this is a nice machine .,3,2,2,4,0
598,598,my only issue is that the display casing is weak .,3,2,2,4,0
599,599,i feel i need to be extra careful when opening the laptop .,3,2,2,4,0
600,600,besides that though i love it .,3,2,2,4,0
601,601,plays my games well and does n't look gaudy like so many other gaming laptops .,3,2,2,4,0

607,607,"ill be comparing this to an older laptop that i got from frys rocking a 960m and a 6th gen laptop was also a 15.6 inch ips display but the rgb percentage was much higher to being the same quality i have on my desktop , this dell has an ips display but i think its somewhere around 50 % rgb so colors",3,2,2,4,0
608,608,"it is also heavier so it is a little cumbersome to carry trackpad on this is very very good , i enjoy it and can actually do productivity work without the need of a mouse which is great , the touchpad on my older laptop was garbage .",3,2,2,4,0

610,610,it has the ability to max out any game i have tried on it so far with good framerates but if i do the fans kick on really loud and depending on the game the section above the keys can get really hot to you play off battery it will limit itself to 30fps on any game and run reasonable cool and,3,2,2,4,0
611,611,"both at 1080 and no issues at  my old laptop would get 2-3 hours of non gaming use off battery and 30 mins if i launched any game , be it older games from the xbox360 era like ff13 or modern games .",3,2,2,4,0
612,612,basically cant use it on the other hand .,3,2,2,4,0
613,613,was able to run 8-10 hours of non gaming use depending on brightness ( 40 % -60 % ) ( 100 % brightness got me about 6 hours ) which is really good for a gaming laptop .,3,2,2,4,0
614,614,also another thing to note is that if you are just browsing youtube or typing up stuff the fans wont kick in and the laptop will be passively cooled so there will be no noise to bother others if you are in a library off battery would get me a little less than 3 hours for older games like ff13 .,3,2,2,4,0
615,615,"and 90 minutes for more demanding modern games like nier and rust so its possible to have a quick gaming session on the go when there is no plug to be you want to buy this laptop i recommend you buy it from costco because it is currently $ 750 right now , add in 8 gigs of ram and add in",3,2,2,4,0

618,618,"if you plan on playing demanding games , i recommend using some good quality headphones .",3,2,2,4,0
619,619,"fans will often kick in soon after launching a game , and will stay on 5-10 minutes after stopping .",3,2,2,4,0
620,620,"i ’ ve looked online to try and find a way to cut back on the fan speed , as they often don ’ t need to spin as fast as they do ( the thermals are great on this device ) but it appears that dell designed this machine to always have the fans spin relatively quickly when playing games .",3,2,2,4,0
621,621,"aside from this minor issue , the laptop is a great purchase , perfect for anyone looking for a reliable , well built machine .",3,2,2,4,0
622,622,you won ’ t be disappointed !,3,2,2,4,0
623,623,it has a very good video card .,3,2,2,4,0
624,624,but it does n't have dvd rom and vga port .,3,2,2,4,0
625,625,the empty unused space on the left and right of the screen is also not so nice .,3,2,2,4,0
626,626,touch pad not so smooth .,3,2,2,4,0

629,629,its ok .,3,2,2,4,0
630,630,plays games great but the images are a little distorted when you are moving your mouse too much .,3,2,2,4,0
631,631,overall i recommend getting a pc if you are planning on strictly playing games !,3,2,2,4,0
632,632,"when you purchase this laptop , allow yourself a full day to set it up .",3,7,2,5,4
633,633,"first you will need about 3 hours to charge the battery , then windows updates will take a couple of hours .",3,7,2,5,4
634,634,"then it will take some time to get rid of the junk that all new computers come with ( i 'm not a gamer , so lots of games had to go ) .",3,7,2,5,4
635,635,"if you are a windows 10 pro , then you should be good to go .",3,7,2,5,4
636,636,"the last windows computer i had was xp , so win 10 took a while to get used to .",3,7,2,5,4
637,637,"i wo n't trade my mac for anything , but i was at the point where i needed a new laptop to take on appointments with clients , and since they are all pc users it only made sense to go with a windows computer is n't really gold at all , but more of a silvery color .",3,7,2,5,4
638,638,"i was worried that it would be flashy and `` in your face '' gold , but it is very caps lock button does n't let you know it is on , and that can get annoying when you accidentally hit it .",3,7,2,5,4
639,639,"there is also no separate numerical keypad , but maybe that is normal for laptops .",3,7,2,5,4
640,640,"i am more of a desktop technology is great , although about half the time it does n't recognize me the first time and i have to do it again .",3,7,2,5,4
641,641,"still , much faster than typing a password .",3,7,2,5,4
642,642,"startup is super fast , literally only a few seconds .",3,7,2,5,4
643,643,"i was initially only looking for a $ 400 or so laptop since this wo n't get much use , but i am glad i splurged and got something with a much better processor and a ssd for the operating laptop weighs next to nothing , and the screen is about the thickness of a few pieces of cardstock .",3,7,2,5,4
644,644,"really , it 's very impressive .",3,7,2,5,4
645,645,"i am still on my first battery charge , and have probably gotten 5-6 hours out of it , but it is warning me now that it is only downside so far is no dvd drive .",3,7,2,5,4
646,646,but i picked up an external asus zen drive ( ) for $ 29 and it works great .,3,7,2,5,4
647,647,"i do n't need it often , but my imac does n't have a drive either , so now i am all set for both computers since it is plug and , i 'm very impressed and glad that i chose this model out of the i looked at on amazon before deciding .",3,7,2,5,4
648,648,"i was worried that it would n't have enough ram , and apparently your warranty is void if you put more in .",3,7,2,5,4
649,649,but so far it is very adequate .,3,7,2,5,4
650,650,"if , after trying to run photoshop and a bunch of other programs all at once it seems to be lagging , then i will update my review .",3,7,2,5,4
651,651,"this is a punchy little laptop for its price that pleasantly surprised me in a lot of ways , and disappointed me in others .",3,7,2,5,4
652,652,"part of my amazement with some of it probably has to do with the fact that my everyday workhorse laptop is a couple of years old , now .",3,7,2,5,4
653,653,it certainly feels outdated next to this thing !,3,7,2,5,4
654,654,i 'll start with the good .,3,7,2,5,4
655,655, the laptop is really light .,3,7,2,5,4
656,656,"when the box came , my husband did n't believe there could really be a laptop inside .",3,7,2,5,4
657,657,he thought i was joking when i told him that 's what it was .,3,7,2,5,4
658,658,"weight does n't honestly matter to me that much because i do n't tote my laptop around , but if weight 's an issue for you -- i really ca n't imagine laptops getting much lighter than this .",3,7,2,5,4
659,659, it turns on fast .,3,7,2,5,4
660,660,really fast .,3,7,2,5,4
661,661,"it has the os on a solid state drive , and then a terabyte drive for storage , and the advantage to this is that solid state drives boot up super fast .",3,7,2,5,4
662,662,"this is a laptop that i 'd have less of a problem with shutting down regularly , because turning it back on again takes about the same amount of time as it takes my laptop to come out of sleep mode .",3,7,2,5,4
663,663,it 's that fast .,3,7,2,5,4
664,664, it packs a fair amount of power without the heat .,3,7,2,5,4
665,665,"i 've tested it on both overwatch and minecraft , and while it wo n't do either of those games at their best graphics settings ( or even ) , it does run them , and runs them smoothly .",3,7,2,5,4
666,666,"moreover , it does so without producing a lot of heat , which surprised me .",3,7,2,5,4
667,667,"i have ordered a fancy chill pad to go with this laptop , since i anticipate it 's going to be doing a lot of playing games with high graphics requirements , but i 'm not seeing a lot of heat issues , even without it .",3,7,2,5,4
668,668, i thought the whole bezel ' thing was silly until i saw this laptop 's screen .,3,7,2,5,4
669,669,it really does make my old laptop 's screen seem outdated and clunky .,3,7,2,5,4
670,670," the speakers are decent , for what they are .",3,7,2,5,4
671,671,"they do n't have much of a bass , but they did bring out some things in the other registers of the music i was listening to that impressed me .",3,7,2,5,4
672,672,"if you just want , thump , thump ' , they 're not the speakers for you , but they might hold up okay , for music that has a little more than that going on .",3,7,2,5,4
673,673, battery life was pretty decent .,3,7,2,5,4
674,674,"my roommate played overwatch for hours on it and did n't realize that it was n't plugged the bad   this is the biggest concern i have with this laptop  the charger gets really hot , and the wire itself seems flimsy .",3,7,2,5,4
675,675,"between the hot charger and the flimsy wire , i 'm expecting that my charger is n't going to last long .",3,7,2,5,4
676,676,"this is n't something i 'm terribly comfortable leaving plugged in and walking away , either .",3,7,2,5,4
677,677," it comes with a lot of bloatware which you then have to go through and uninstall , which is kindof a pain .",3,7,2,5,4
678,678,i do n't get why companies do this .,3,7,2,5,4
679,679,"also , it tries to push mcafee on you .",3,7,2,5,4

681,681," the speakers , while decent , could be better .",3,7,2,5,4
682,682,"but i 've been saying that about my laptops for years , and have yet to own one where they are better .",3,7,2,5,4
683,683,"still , when my iphone has better sound , it feels like there 's room for improvement .",3,7,2,5,4
684,684," given how light and thin it is , i 'd actually be a little afraid to tote this thing around too much without some kind of really protective case .",3,7,2,5,4
685,685,it seems like it could get damaged too easily .,3,7,2,5,4
686,686,the laptop is a good value for what it provides .,3,7,2,5,4
687,687,"but , the screen and sound though fair are a little underwhelming .",3,7,2,5,4
688,688,my older asus has much brighter screen and it sounds a lot better than this else is top -- -- update have used this laptop for a month now .,3,7,2,5,4
689,689,"to be fair , the display and sound are both as one would expect other laptops in the price bracket .",3,7,2,5,4
690,690,"in the era of rating inflation , i will up my rating to full 5 stars .",3,7,2,5,4
691,691,i 've had this laptop for a few months and i love it a lot .,3,7,2,5,4
692,692,it boots up in seconds and makes it so easy to get on task faster .,3,7,2,5,4
693,693,i take it with me to school and its light enough that i do n't feel like i 'm carrying bricks .,3,7,2,5,4
694,694,the battery lasts for 7 hrs and i usually dont charge it for two days bc i mostly use it for school work and only play one game on steam .,3,7,2,5,4
695,695,"i do n't really use it for heavy software , so i do n't know how powerful it is for that.m main problem , though , is that sometimes the mousepad will stop working for a minute or two , or it will lag , but with my wireless mouse it 's fine .",3,7,2,5,4
696,696,it never lags or stops working .,3,7,2,5,4
697,697,"with the mousepad , i will try to right click but it will act like i intended to left click .",3,7,2,5,4
698,698,"it 's frustrating , since i dont take my wireless mouse with me , i 'm happy with it .",3,7,2,5,4
699,699,"as reviewed  , 8gb ram and 1tb hybrid am very happy with this little laptop .",3,7,2,5,4
700,700,now i 'm a person who ca n't stand the current trend towards tablets and touchscreens .,3,7,2,5,4
701,701,i 'm an engineering student and have a powerful desktop setup with two 219 monitors and regularly use both when i 'm doing homework .,3,7,2,5,4
702,702,i 'm bothered by little details and expect higher performance than the average user .,3,7,2,5,4
703,703,i needed a laptop to bring to my internship and carry with me to classes so i started looking for a small laptop with decent specs .,3,7,2,5,4
704,704,for me this laptop matched everything i needed at a reasonable price.the main selling points for me were  portable ips a nice i got my hands on it i had some thoughts on it .,3,7,2,5,4
705,705,i was pleasantly surprised by how rigid the chassis feels despite being plastic .,3,7,2,5,4
706,706,"when i first started using it i was n't sure i 'd like the track pad , but in use i have n't noticed it at all , it 's functioned exactly how i want it to .",3,7,2,5,4
707,707,"i consider the keyboard to be good , i 'd prefer a more clicky experience but i ca n't fault anything about it .",3,7,2,5,4
708,708,i feel fast and accurate typing on it .,3,7,2,5,4
709,709,i installed linux mint on it and it runs perfectly without tweaking .,3,7,2,5,4
710,710,the only feature that does n't work on mint is the fingerprint scanner .,3,7,2,5,4
711,711,"the hybrid drive is tolerable , not as quick as an ssd but i 'm not bothered by it .",3,7,2,5,4
712,712,"the speakers have a decent sound for a laptop , albeit a higher max volume would be conclusion this laptop offered everything i wanted at a reasonable price .",3,7,2,5,4
713,713,the functionality is on par with more premium offerings and it still maintains a solid build quality and good looks .,3,7,2,5,4
714,714,if you 're looking for a traditional laptop in this size i feel comfortable recommending it .,3,7,2,5,4
715,715,i plan on updating this review if anything happens as time goes on to change my opinion of it .,3,7,2,5,4
716,716,"this item was delivered on august 7th , advertised this laptop is extremely light , and also very discounted a few stars because  - the colors are weird .",3,7,2,5,4
717,717,sometimes they look dull and other times they are just simply wrong .,3,7,2,5,4
718,718,tried using intel hd graphics control panel to match the settings with those of an older asus laptop but they seemed to be the same already .,3,7,2,5,4
719,719,"some windows update , the colors are better but there 's still a faint yellowish tint .",3,7,2,5,4
720,720,have n't tried bios reset box it was delivered in alongside with an external cd reader was too big and with little to no protection .,3,7,2,5,4
721,721,"the order was handled by amazon , note  - the plug is on the power brick , which might be inconvenient in some the audio is very nice , but the location of the speakers makes it so that they may get covered when no caps lock light or alert .",3,7,2,5,4
722,722,replacing an 8 year old 17 '' acer i ordered two different acers only to return them both .,3,7,2,5,4
723,723,this asus is great .,3,7,2,5,4
724,724,i love the configuration .,3,7,2,5,4
725,725,"its elegant , fast as hell and excellent choice for home computing .",3,7,2,5,4
726,726,i use a macbook air at work and it has nothing on my new asus .,3,7,2,5,4
727,727,thanks to amazon prime and their return policy i 've got the the perfect laptop for my needs .,3,7,2,5,4
728,728,"great laptop , the only thing that sucks is the battery life .",3,7,2,5,4
729,729,"the wi-fi is super fast and connect 's to router 's far away , it boots up and shuts down in seconds .",3,7,2,5,4
730,730,it is so fast ! !,3,7,2,5,4

732,732,"it has everything i could have ask for , with fair price tag .",3,7,2,5,4
733,733,i highly recommend this laptop to anyone who does n't care about bringing their charger with them .,3,7,2,5,4
734,734,"i also suggest you buy a screen protector for this computer , it gets fingerprints on it so easily , it not one of those displays that has a plastic cover over it like display is very nice and has a hdr like feel to it , the color depth is great , very hd .",3,7,2,5,4
735,735,"i would recommend you buy a case or skin for this laptop , amazon seller 's sell a nice kit that comes with a skin and screen protector for 20 $ ! !",3,7,2,5,4
736,736,overall good laptop so far ...,3,7,2,5,4
737,737,i spent a good amount of time searching for a decent laptop .,3,7,2,5,4
738,738,"i was stuck between a mac and an asus , i ended up going with this laptop ... was looking for a laptop with a lot of memory , i 'm becoming a coder so i needed plenty of space for my applications and programs .",3,7,2,5,4
739,739,"this laptop has it 's pros and cons , just like anything else does .",3,7,2,5,4
740,740,"i 'll start with pros  the look of it is very nice and sleek i must say , space , of course , is a big plus to me , i really just love asus as a whole honestly .",3,7,2,5,4
741,741,"cons  the battery life is n't as spectacular as i would think it would be , the speakers are not that great , although i stream it through my tv so that does n't really matter too much .",3,7,2,5,4
742,742,"sometimes , it will randomly freeze , not too long but long i will say it 's a good computer and i 'm pleased with it .",3,7,2,5,4
743,743,"so depending on what you are looking for in terms of use , i would suggest this one if it would suit your needs .",3,7,2,5,4
744,744,"i bought this laptop to decommission a dall unit from 2012 which served me very well , also being a 15.6 inch .",3,7,2,5,4
745,745,it was pretty difficult trying to find an all around good laptop that fit all my criteria but this one mostly does it - 80 % of the body is a light sturdy plastic .,3,7,2,5,4
746,746,the cover on the screen lid is a metal sheet that makes the lid pretty sturdy .,3,7,2,5,4
747,747,i like the weight of it and it does n't seem flimsy at all .,3,7,2,5,4
748,748,"it looks great and premium has a good selection of ports and a full size sd - i came from a 768p laptop which was the worst , so jumping to 1080p is an irreversible step i 've taken .",3,7,2,5,4
749,749,it 's very vivid and colors are n't too saturated .,3,7,2,5,4
750,750,"the brightness is on the low side and would be nice if it could get about 20 % brighter and it is a matte finish and gives very decent - my laptop is usually a desk queen , but i have tested the battery and it 's decent .",3,7,2,5,4
751,751,light use would see about 6 hours of life and hard use would be closer to hours .,3,7,2,5,4
752,752,the battery time estimate is erratic and sometimes seems & touchpad - so i was expecting to have to relearn a new keyboard but i guess since the main body is only slightly smaller than my last laptop so it 's almost basically all the same spacing and everything .,3,7,2,5,4
753,753,there is no function key lock which i seemed to take for granted previously but it 's not a big deal .,3,7,2,5,4
754,754,"this keyboard is backlit and has 3 different levels of brightness , brightness 1 is enough for me so +1 to that .",3,7,2,5,4
755,755,"the keys are n't loose and typing on them is i think satisfying , they 're somewhat quiet when pushed .",3,7,2,5,4
756,756,"people complain about how the power button is right next to the delete key , but for me personally i do n't find this an issue at the touch pad is n't good , your fingers do n't slide over it easily , it grabs your finger really odd .",3,7,2,5,4
757,757,"it clicks great , but i wo n't be trying to use is at all .",3,7,2,5,4
758,758,would recommend a bluetooth mouse at all times .,3,7,2,5,4
759,759,the fingerprint reader has n't failed & speed - my model is the i7 ...,3,7,2,5,4
760,760,it 's basically an i5 but with a quicker clock speed .,3,7,2,5,4
761,761,still dual core ( bummer ... thanks intel ) and turbo boosts to .,3,7,2,5,4
762,762,my base clock speed according to windows and also intel 's own driver software says .,3,7,2,5,4
763,763,i wish i had gotten a model with an actual i7 instead of an i5 with an i7 badge .,3,7,2,5,4
764,764,"fan noise is overall quiet until you run something that puts it at over 50 % cpu usage but even still , it 's manageable .",3,7,2,5,4
765,765,keep your power settings to ' because performance ' keeps it permanently @ model with dedicated graphics would be worth it if you 're more than a less than casual - bluetooth is quick to reconnect a mouse when turning on the laptop .,3,7,2,5,4
766,766,"at the same spot my last laptop was , this one gets ' signal whereas my other one would get ' to the sometimes & sound - so out of the box it does n't sound good , neither do .",3,7,2,5,4
767,767,"you 'll need to play music and then adjust the eq to make it sound nice , but when you do it sounds as good as you can make it .",3,7,2,5,4
768,768,my previous dell laptop has the best speakers and the best eq settings for headphonesspeakers i 've ever heard so i had to make lots of adjustments through the eq of this laptop to make it sound as close as i can as my last computer .,3,7,2,5,4
769,769,"i got it pretty close but still not perfect , but i can live with it !",3,7,2,5,4
770,770,"the weird this is this computer comes with like 3 programs that control eq which is very confusing , and they all are n't mutually exclusive so they all build on each other .",3,7,2,5,4
771,771,for this reason i recommend doing it though the ' program .,3,7,2,5,4
772,772,i 'm not a computer wiz by any means so i actually had a friend of mine help me pick out a new laptop .,3,7,2,5,4
773,773,he 's very tech savvy and basically explained to me that this is probably the best bang for my do n't do any gaming or social media on this .,3,7,2,5,4
774,774,i just use it to buy more stuff i do n't need on amazon and write papers in word .,3,7,2,5,4
775,775,maybe watch the occasional video .,3,7,2,5,4
776,776,pretty simple use so i do n't know how it would handle a bigger extra hard drive is cool .,3,7,2,5,4
777,777,again i do n't know much about computers so i just kinda have it but i 'm sure if i ever wanted to download large files or anything that would be super biometrics part is nice .,3,7,2,5,4
778,778,you can only have one registered print so it has to be the same finger in the same spot every time which is probably my biggest complaint .,3,7,2,5,4
779,779,"i might be spoiled because my phone has i think 5 registered fingerprints so i can be in a different position or use my left hand if i want , where on this computer i i definitely like it .",3,7,2,5,4
780,780,it 's very fast and very clear .,3,7,2,5,4
781,781,my old computer was a cheap walmart computer so this blows it out of the water .,3,7,2,5,4
782,782,i would definitely buy it again .,3,7,2,5,4
783,783,i was very nervous to buy this laptop because i was n't sure how it would be but i love it .,3,7,2,5,4
784,784,it 's worked well for the past 2 months i 've had it .,3,7,2,5,4
785,785,"it is very quick , especially when it boots up .",3,7,2,5,4
786,786,the screen has an amazing display and there are no real issues with the product .,3,7,2,5,4
787,787,"the only downfall is that there is no cddvd player , and the keys are n't really backlit , but other than that it functions as it should !",3,7,2,5,4
788,788,this laptop has a feel of very high quality .,3,7,2,5,4
789,789,"also , the parts have good quality for the price .",3,7,2,5,4
790,790,"my wife uses it for studying , and leaves everything open .",3,7,2,5,4
791,791,"the memory in the laptop has been able to handle everything open , and the ssd drive makes the boot time quick .",3,7,2,5,4
792,792,another great feature is the battery life .,3,7,2,5,4
793,793,it has a really long lasting battery .,3,7,2,5,4
794,794,this is a good laptop for someone looking for a higher end model laptop for work .,3,7,2,5,4
795,795,this is a pretty solid laptop .,3,7,2,5,4
796,796,i purchased it about a week ago and it has performed my expectations .,3,7,2,5,4
797,797,"i switched to this laptop from a toshiba satellite , which had such a low processing power that it took an hour for chrome to open .",3,7,2,5,4
798,798,this has an i7 processor which keeps its speeds crisp and quick .,3,7,2,5,4
799,799,"to make things easy , i will outline the .",3,7,2,5,4
800,800,"fast , good .",3,7,2,5,4
801,801,back-lit .,3,7,2,5,4
802,802,"lightweight , .",3,7,2,5,4
803,803,excellent usb port access ( 3 of them ) 5 .,3,7,2,5,4
804,804,"crisp , vibrant screen .",3,7,2,5,4
805,805,"reasonable battery life for a laptop of this size , price are a few cons though , but they are n't significant enough for me to lower my .",3,7,2,5,4
806,806,no cd drive - but this is something i understand since most laptops are made without them .,3,7,2,5,4
807,807,i noticed that anything is a bit cumbersome .,3,7,2,5,4
808,808,the ports seem a bit too tight for .,3,7,2,5,4
809,809,"poor webcam  the built-in webcam is grainy and is low far , everything else seems pretty good .",3,7,2,5,4
810,810,the pros definitely outweigh the cons .,3,7,2,5,4
811,811,we 'll see how well this laptop works over the next few months to years .,3,7,2,5,4
812,812,i will edit this review accordingly .,3,7,2,5,4
813,813,great laptop for the price .,3,7,2,5,4
814,814,it meet or exceeded all my expectations after reading many of the reviews on here and from other research online .,3,7,2,5,4
815,815,"my last laptop was an asus that had held up very well and still performs pretty well , so i wanted to stay with a brand that i 've been able to rely on .",3,7,2,5,4
816,816,the fingerprint sensor makes logging in a breeze and it stays up from the scan nearly instantly .,3,7,2,5,4
817,817,occasionally there is a little lag but nothing to bad .,3,7,2,5,4
818,818,this has everything i need for my usage and i 'll probably never touch more than half the memory but it 's nice to have such a large amount of storage just in case .,3,7,2,5,4
819,819,i 've been using it for about a month and a half and no issues have come up with it .,3,7,2,5,4
820,820,bought this computer ( about 3 months ago ) because i wanted something mid range that was travel friendly and could handle basic gaming .,3,7,2,5,4
821,821,i 'm happy to say that this laptop meets all of those criteria .,3,7,2,5,4
822,822,super light weight and boots up fast .,3,7,2,5,4
823,823,i can play league of legends for hours without any issue .,3,7,2,5,4
824,824,some points that may be helpful to some people  my computer crashed after playing games and having a video open in chrome .,3,7,2,5,4
825,825,from my experience the computer life is no where near what is advertised .,3,7,2,5,4
826,826,it 's more like 5-6 hours rather then 10 .,3,7,2,5,4
827,827,"also , a bit disappointed that it did n't come with a longer , more sturdy power cord with a ground .",3,7,2,5,4
828,828,just came with a standard two pronged power adapter .,3,7,2,5,4
829,829,"all that said though , i 'm very happy with my purchase .",3,7,2,5,4
830,830,"definitely a good buy if you 're looking for something travel friendly , and something that can handle standard tasks plus a little more .",3,7,2,5,4
831,831,"as an experienced windows 10 user , this laptop was absolutely beyond my expectations after i purchased it .",3,7,2,5,4
832,832,i 've had it for almost 3 months and the performance is amazing .,3,7,2,5,4
833,833,"it 's very fast even on slower internet speeds , and weighs very little with a very sleek design .",3,7,2,5,4
834,834,i can store almost anything with the storage capabilities .,3,7,2,5,4
835,835,i rated this laptop 5 stars because i could n't imagine anything better .,3,7,2,5,4
836,836,the only thing i would change if i could is the quality of the webcam .,3,7,2,5,4
837,837,it 's low pixel and not the best for video chatting .,3,7,2,5,4
838,838,the speakers are okay with adequate bass .,3,7,2,5,4
839,839,i 've only had dell laptops before but i will definitely be purchasing asus again in the future .,3,7,2,5,4
840,840,a great laptop .,3,7,2,5,4
841,841,the weight is a killer spec .,3,7,2,5,4
842,842,only 1.6 kilogram which is 1.5 times less then my previous 15 '' laptop .,3,7,2,5,4
843,843,the screen is ok ( better then my previous laptop but not as good as my desktop ) .,3,7,2,5,4
844,844,combo is good if you need both speed and storage .,3,7,2,5,4
845,845,i initially thought that just ssd would be a better option so it would be a little bit lighter and spent less power ( but would have less storage ) .,3,7,2,5,4
846,846,battery is disappointing a little bit ( it is not a long lasting one .,3,7,2,5,4
847,847,"i initially thought it would be enough for a day , but it is actually for 3-5 hours of work ) like the keyboard and touchpad .",3,7,2,5,4
848,848,as well as fingerprint which allows to log in great product .,3,7,2,5,4
849,849,"this is a great computer , be it a laptop or a vivo book .",3,7,2,5,4
850,850,no matter what you call it it works .,3,7,2,5,4
851,851,i love the metal body and the finish on it .,3,7,2,5,4
852,852,"it has all the things i wanted including , i7 , i have used asus line several times and they have been great about walking me through any problem i was having .",3,7,2,5,4
853,853,this was purchase for my wife .,3,7,2,5,4
854,854,she loves it .,3,7,2,5,4
855,855,she is very impressed with the performance .,3,7,2,5,4
856,856,"the slim , light weight package is a plus .",3,7,2,5,4
857,857,"great screen size and not too heavy , thinner than most .",3,7,2,5,4
858,858,amazon prime delivery delayed,3,7,2,5,4
859,859,i have had this laptop for a few days now and i love it !,3,7,2,5,4
860,860,it is very fast .,3,7,2,5,4
861,861,"the only thing that i wish it had ( and i knew this before purchasing ) is a numeric keypad , so i have to use the number buttons on the top .",3,7,2,5,4
862,862,the fingerprint scanner is also a very nice feature .,3,7,2,5,4
863,863,lightweight and has solid state drive which makes it start up super fast .,3,7,2,5,4
864,864,"i also like that the keyboard design helps keep it clean , my previous laptop accumulated all sorts of stuff between the keys .",3,7,2,5,4
865,865,however it is a bit too sensitive for me and any small touch is interpreted as a movement .,3,7,2,5,4
866,866,also the battery life does not 6 hours as stated .,3,7,2,5,4
867,867,it ’ s so lightweight !,3,7,2,5,4
868,868,i ’ ve had it for about two months .,3,7,2,5,4
869,869,"don ’ t love the at all , but that ’ s easily solved by using a plug in .",3,7,2,5,4
870,870,"light , good size screen , fast , and reliable !",3,7,2,5,4
871,871,absolutely love this laptop .,3,7,2,5,4

874,874,strong wireless connection .,3,7,2,5,4
875,875,very portable and light weight .,3,7,2,5,4
876,876,fast processing .,3,7,2,5,4
877,877,probably the best computer i 've ever purchased .,3,7,2,5,4
878,878,"typing responsiveness is fast , log in time fast , overall performance fast .",3,7,2,5,4
879,879,this company has taken laptop use to a whole new level .,3,7,2,5,4
880,880,i use it for school and have no problem paring it via bluetooth to any other device necessary .,3,7,2,5,4
881,881,love this computer !,3,7,2,5,4
882,882,great purchase for the money .,3,7,2,5,4
883,883,it 's quick and reliable .,3,7,2,5,4
884,884,no complaints !,3,7,2,5,4
885,885,love it .,3,7,2,5,4
886,886,received in good quality and with backlit keyboard .,3,7,2,5,4
887,887,however the excel inside need to be re-installed for the account keeps showing unlicensed .,3,7,2,5,4
888,888,the 15.6 inch screen looks great .,3,7,2,5,4
889,889,"great price , great features and a good looking laptop ! !",3,7,2,5,4
890,890,!,3,7,2,5,4
891,891,don ’ t get me wrong  this laptop is light years ahead of any computer i have ever owned .,3,7,2,5,4
892,892,"it is slim , light , fast , great i really wanted one that had an ssd and hard drive so i could work quickly but store a lot of photographs and at work .",3,7,2,5,4
893,893,but for streaming video it is terrible – the sound is very quiet and very muffled .,3,7,2,5,4
894,894,i don ’ t want to have to get external speakers or wear headphones every time i want to watch a show .,3,7,2,5,4
895,895,haven ’ t decided if i ’ m going to return it but i ’ m very disappointed .,3,7,2,5,4
896,896,nice screen .,3,7,2,5,4
897,897,like the touch pad .,3,7,2,5,4
898,898,nice laptop ... quick and responsive .,3,7,2,5,4
899,899,"overall , the laptop works well while having an appealing design -- however , there are many different factors that will make you hate this computer .",3,7,2,5,4
900,900,"first , the graphics are terrible -- even with intel integrated graphics , the computer can not manage to perform tasks that are simple in terms of graphical demand .",3,7,2,5,4
901,901,"while the computer can run videos on youtube , it can not manage to run netflix ( i have 150mbps , so it is not due to my internet connection ) .",3,7,2,5,4
902,902,"the image usually appears extremely blurry , and there is nothing you can do to resolve this issue .",3,7,2,5,4
903,903,"secondly , the speakers sound average at best , but the major issues are due to the speaker 's location , which is directly under the computer -- you must have the computer on a straight , solid surface in order to hear the sound -- placing your laptop on your bed or carpet will make the sound very difficult to hear .",3,7,2,5,4
904,904,"thirdly , the battery life is terrible -- if i 'm doing the slightest amount of work on my computer , the battery is dead within 1-3 hours .",3,7,2,5,4
905,905,"lastly , if you are into gaming , this computer fails in every category .",3,7,2,5,4
906,906,"obviously , this computer is not designed to handle gaming , but playing games that are very basic , two dimensional , and primitive can barely run .",3,7,2,5,4
907,907,"on the plus side , this laptop will fulfill all of your basic needs ( word , powerpoint , email , small projects , video chat ) reiterate , here are the pros and cons  pros  - attractive performs small application very light-up can handle overall thin  - highly fails",3,7,2,5,4
908,908,fastest pc out there,3,7,2,5,4
909,909,"good build quality , light to carry around the best audio quality , but is good for people who use it for office using it for media purposes , its not the best option .",3,7,2,5,4
910,910,"user observations on the asus s  the intel core processor lets me bring up applications far more quickly than on any computer i have had though the laptop frame size is what traditionally has house a 14 ” monitor , the narrow bezel allows it to hold a 15.6 ” monitor it seems is no wasted space and",3,7,2,5,4
911,911,it is lighter and slimmer than previous laptops i ’ ve had and has an attractive brushed metal finish that really appeals to me.my only complaint is that the delete key is right next to the power button .,3,7,2,5,4
912,912,"this , according to murphy ’ s law means that the likelihood that you will accidentally shut the computer off will increase in direct proportion to the importance of the document you are working on .",3,7,2,5,4
913,913,"for this reason , i give this computer four stars .",3,7,2,5,4
914,914,"aside from that , i loved it .",3,7,2,5,4
915,915,i bought this for my son when he started college this fall .,3,7,2,5,4
916,916,he loves it .,3,7,2,5,4
917,917,i got it 2 days after i ordered it .,3,7,2,5,4
918,918,"the screen is nice and big , it is extremely light weight , and it is just looks nice .",3,7,2,5,4
919,919,great full-featured windows 10 laptop .,3,7,2,5,4
920,920,"it has pretty much any port you would want , including usb for future applications .",3,7,2,5,4
921,921,i wish that it charged like my asus chromebook  with usb ; but i would guess it 's because it uses more power than the connection can supply .,3,7,2,5,4
922,922,"right out of the box i had an application for it  i installed kodi with my plex add-on , then connected it to my tv via hdmi and i was running home movies via my plex server in less than 20 with any oem laptop , there is some bloatware to it .",3,7,2,5,4
923,923,i uninstalled most of it .,3,7,2,5,4
924,924,the year subscription to mcafee is a joke  go with comodo if you want a quality security application .,3,7,2,5,4
925,925,this laptop has many excellent features .,3,7,2,5,4
926,926,it is super light so you won ’ t get shoulder strain if you want to carry it around all day in a laptop bag .,3,7,2,5,4
927,927,"the laptop just looks nice , from the backlit keyboard to the clear bright screen .",3,7,2,5,4
928,928,it starts up quickly .,3,7,2,5,4
929,929,"the specs are impressive and it has performed great so far with internet use , photo editing , word processing , and some steam gaming .",3,7,2,5,4
930,930,"i don ’ t think this would be the best system for a hardcore gaming machine , but it ’ s great for games that are not extremely system demanding .",3,7,2,5,4
931,931,it has a good size hard drive which is a definite plus .,3,7,2,5,4
932,932,"overall , an nice machine that should perform well for someone needing to do typical home computer work and light gaming .",3,7,2,5,4
933,933,"i would try to be as neutral as i can because even after getting the defective device , i would do a full analysis .",3,7,2,5,4
934,934,"when i received the laptop , the first impression was amazing but i was only able to use it foe about 10minutes .",3,7,2,5,4

1113,1113,"it looks a bit aggressive though , with all lights on ( which you can turn off ) but nothing  - heavy .",4,7,5,5,0
1114,1114,"along with the adapter , which has a weight and a shape of a real brick , it makes a pretty heavy kit .",4,7,5,5,0

1126,1126,i did n't know that and it 's a huge bummer .,4,7,5,5,0
1127,1127,pros  a lot of computer for the price ! it has 2x ssds ( mine were 2 128gb ) running in raid 0 and a 1tb hard drive with space for one more .,4,7,5,5,0

1138,1138,there is a second sata drive bay empty but the couple cents cable for a second hdd is not included and it is outrageously priced on the secondary market .,4,7,5,5,0

1152,1152,i spend a month doing research and know i feel i took the right choice .,4,7,5,5,0
1153,1153,there are many light weight powerfull gaming laptops out there but not with this termal management and built quality .,4,7,5,5,0
1154,1154,i really like this laptop .,4,7,5,5,0
1155,1155,it is indeed quite fast especially noticeable at startup .,4,7,5,5,0
1156,1156,note that two slots for the memory are installed in a more difficult to access location ( requires taking laptop apart ) .,4,7,5,5,0

1158,1158,i used the crucial memeory ( ballistix sport ) .,4,7,5,5,0
1159,1159,also note that the solid state drives are 2 x 128 gb which i find unfortunate because i had wanted to add a larger solid state drive but found the slots were both taken .,4,7,5,5,0
1160,1160,therefore to upgrade the size of the solid state drive or drives you have to image your hardrive somewhere and copy it over to a new drive .,4,7,5,5,0

1163,1163,i really love this machine .,4,7,5,5,0
1164,1164,i usually buy msi products but this one seem much for geek oriented when it come to upgrading as it does not take someone with an engineering degree to do the simple things .,4,7,5,5,0
1165,1165,their gui software utilities are good i only wish their bios screen was much more advanced like the msi one is .,4,7,5,5,0
1166,1166,"also , on the downside , i do not understand why they put a gaming computer ssds in the raid mode even if it is raid 0 .",4,7,5,5,0
1167,1167,"it is locked so as of last questioning of support you have to swap out the & and replace then to get rid of the raid function which even a basic gamer like me could see that the speed tests were bottle necking there ... , support will tell you the max for the ssd cards is 512gb .",4,7,5,5,0
1168,1168,"that is not true as a simple youtube search will show you that you can put a 1tb and 1tb in the machine and it works great and though it worked right out of the box of the spare memory ports would not work , the mother board was not communicating with it .",4,7,5,5,0

1171,1171,"shared that spec with acer support as they did not seem to have those specs dropped the rating by 1 star because of acer 's tech support ... i should not have had to provide the memory slot specs for this unit to get them to double check and see that the memory slot should work ... , they know they have",4,7,5,5,0

1941,1941,only thing negative i can say is that the touchpad is a little finicky and i wish it had a backlit keyboard ( my fault for not researching it enough ) .,3,6,2,1,7
1942,1942,i use this with a docking station so the touchpad is not really an issue though .,3,6,2,1,7

2404,2404,"that said , if i 'm doing some kind of big download then other things i 'm doing do tend to slow down , but remember - 6mb bandwidth plus three of us in my home are using the internet at the same time .",3,2,1,5,7
2405,2405,i also make sure nothing updates automatically .,3,2,1,5,7
2406,2406,that includes all applications and windows 10 .,3,2,1,5,7
2407,2407,nothing more irritating than trying to do something and then some automatic update starts in the background and slows everything down or even makes your laptop seem to lock up .,3,2,1,5,7
2408,2408,i just manually check for and start updates when i find it convenient to do so .,3,2,1,5,7
2409,2409,i can but do n't schedule auto updates to happen in the wee hours .,3,2,1,5,7
2410,2410,neither do i allow anything to send usage statistics or any other information up to its creators .,3,2,1,5,7
2411,2411,waste of bandwidth and computer resources .,3,2,1,5,7
2412,2412,something else i 've noticed .,3,2,1,5,7
2413,2413,do n't think i 'm crazy .,3,2,1,5,7
2414,2414,"i do n't know what it 's doing , but if i leave my browser open to amazon then my laptop - any laptop i 've had - seems to run slower over time .",3,2,1,5,7
2415,2415,i tended to leave it for days on end until i figured out what was going on .,3,2,1,5,7
2416,2416,i resolved this by just not leaving my browser open on amazon or at all for that products have defects .,3,2,1,5,7
2417,2417,it happens .,3,2,1,5,7
2418,2418,when i bought my brand new jeep ten years ago the electronic sway bar disconnects did n't work .,3,2,1,5,7
2419,2419,how did i feel spending over thirty grand ( all the bells and whistles ) and it did n't work right ,3,2,1,5,7
2420,2420,it took three frustrating trips to the dealer to get it fixed .,3,2,1,5,7
2421,2421,on my third trip i made them replace the whole system .,3,2,1,5,7
2422,2422,fixed .,3,2,1,5,7
2423,2423,i still drive that jeep today .,3,2,1,5,7
2424,2424,i like this laptop .,3,2,1,5,7
2425,2425,it works great for me .,3,2,1,5,7
2426,2426,i can easily recommend it for the casual user .,3,2,1,5,7
2427,2427,i 'll resolve that minor printing issue .,3,2,1,5,7
2428,2428,"just know the specifications , know what you 're buying here , know what you plan on using it for , have realistic expectations and you 'll be happy .",3,2,1,5,7
2429,2429,"after reading reviews , i realized i paid way i guess i still got a good large bezels & you have to upgrade the hard drive to ssd if you want a quicker laptop .",3,2,1,5,7
2430,2430,( did that the first day ) it has low cons and runs my cad programs really well,3,2,1,5,7
2431,2431,for a budget priced laptop you get a lot of bang for the buck .,3,2,1,5,7
2432,2432,"it was n't loaded with tons of bloatware , either , which is a refreshing change .",3,2,1,5,7
2433,2433,it 's a christmas gift so i opened it to configure it but has n't been used on a daily basis yet .,3,2,1,5,7
2434,2434,"however , unless something unexpected happens it 's a solid 5 stars for value ( price to configuration ) .",3,2,1,5,7
2435,2435,"i 'm really impressed with this laptop , i got just as what was describe in the built quality is so amazing , love the feel of the keyboard , wonderful display quality and resolution and most of all it runs smooth .",3,2,1,5,7
2436,2436,however one of the downside about this laptop is that the battery life is not the best but for the price of this item it 's worth buying it if you 're on a budget !,3,2,1,5,7
2437,2437,there 's also other better versions of this laptop .,3,2,1,5,7
2438,2438,does what i need it to do .,3,2,1,5,7
2439,2439,fast enough .,3,2,1,5,7
2440,2440,"just web browsing , watching movies and stuff , and word processing .",3,2,1,5,7
2441,2441,do n't run much stuff on it other than basic office software .,3,2,1,5,7
2442,2442,does the job for a cheap laptop .,3,2,1,5,7
2443,2443,"graphics are pretty good , but i am not a gamer .",3,2,1,5,7
2444,2444,this is a nice computer .,3,2,1,5,7
2445,2445,the processor is fairly fact and the set up was very easy .,3,2,1,5,7
2446,2446,the only issue with the laptop is that the battery life could be better .,3,2,1,5,7
2447,2447,using it for normal browsing you get approximately 4 hours this is below the 5 hours average as stated by the website .,3,2,1,5,7
2448,2448,for the price this is a really well equipped laptop .,3,2,1,5,7
2449,2449,it is not technically a gaming laptop but it has handled several games very well such as fallout nv and crysis 3 .,3,2,1,5,7
2450,2450,it boots in a respectable amount of time and runs programs without much delay if any .,3,2,1,5,7
2451,2451,"if you ’ re wanting a laptop for word processing , web surfing , movies and occasional gaming , this truly is the best bang for your  battery life is less than stellar but you can still get about 4 hours of use before worrying about finding an washes out unless you are in front of it .",3,2,1,5,7
2452,2452,this could also be a pro since it acts as a type of privacy screen .,3,2,1,5,7
2453,2453,i went from using an hp to this computer and this one is better by leaps and bounds !,3,2,1,5,7
2454,2454,it 's much faster it does n't crash .,3,2,1,5,7
2455,2455,i had no issues with start ups .,3,2,1,5,7
2456,2456,it did n't come with chrome but chrome was super easy to download .,3,2,1,5,7
2457,2457,"i work from home so my laptop is very important and i am on it 12-14 hours a day , this is by far the best laptop i have owned , and it was a great price .",3,2,1,5,7
2458,2458,i think the people with negative review either got a faulty product or are just way to picky .,3,2,1,5,7
2459,2459,this product is great for both my business and personal needs !,3,2,1,5,7
2460,2460,very happy with this purchase !,3,2,1,5,7

2462,2462,i 'm able to run tons of programs for general professional tasks like office apps and emails at once with out any slowdown and works seamlessly .,3,2,1,5,7
2463,2463,also as far as running games - it can definitely run most xbox 360ps3 era games quite well .,3,2,1,5,7
2464,2464,i 've been playing gta iv and fallout 3 connected on my tv and it looks great .,3,2,1,5,7
2465,2465,"but any games with a lot going on and intense graphics have some slowdown , sonic generations for example .",3,2,1,5,7
2466,2466,i would n't bother trying to run something like the witcher 3 or on this though .,3,2,1,5,7
2467,2467,"the laptop took a bit to turn on , but once it did it worked perfectly .",3,2,1,5,7
2468,2468,it 's a bit loud but the noise is manageable .,3,2,1,5,7
2469,2469,the laptop is fast and i do n't have any concerns at the moment .,3,2,1,5,7
2470,2470,it looks great for the price you pay for it .,3,2,1,5,7
2471,2471,the full keypad on the side is pretty awesome .,3,2,1,5,7

2474,2474,and it is powerful and fast .,3,2,1,5,7
2475,2475,"we have recommended it to our friends who are looking for an upgrade , as we were , at an extremely good price .",3,2,1,5,7
2476,2476,and lenovo help desk was superb in answering any questions or concerns we had .,3,2,1,5,7
2477,2477,buy it !,3,2,1,5,7
2478,2478,"sort of a pita to replace the hard disk with ssd , but other than that this baby is nice and fast .",3,2,1,5,7
2479,2479,7th gen apu is great for us in the middle of the bell curve .,3,2,1,5,7
2480,2480,"if you are going to install ssd , then you will need to buy a set of the plastic laptop pry tools so you do n't damage anything - they 're pretty cheap though .",3,2,1,5,7
2481,2481,as stated in other reviews initial updates took unbelievably long to finish now so far so good i personally hate win 10 but the computer seems good for the money spent,3,2,1,5,7
2482,2482,"an excellent laptop for the price , runs well , decent for a lot of different things like a little gaming and word processing .",3,2,1,5,7
2483,2483,"decent graphics , decent storage , sleek design and not too heavy to carry around for a runs down a little fast but then , most laptops do .",3,2,1,5,7
2484,2484,works just as well on low battery though and is good about not losing anything you had in progress when it does die .,3,2,1,5,7
2485,2485,absolutely amazing .,3,2,1,5,7
2486,2486,can use it for school and with the right programs can run most games so if you 're researching what computer is good for gaming and school work at a low price this is definitely the laptop for it .,3,2,1,5,7
2487,2487,i did tons of research before buying it and this one has a great graphics card as well as plenty of storage .,3,2,1,5,7
2488,2488,a very pleasant surprise .,3,2,1,5,7
2489,2489,seems quite snappy and a very good value for the money .,3,2,1,5,7
2490,2490,this laptop straight out of the box will not work for most people as it has many problems and all related to microsoft and not lenovo the laptop itself .,3,2,1,5,7
2491,2491,you will need a tech like my son to fix these problems .,3,2,1,5,7
2492,2492,the resources or cpu 85 % ram 30 % hdd 100 % out of the box on idle .,3,2,1,5,7
2493,2493,"after my son fixed it , resources is cpu 0 % ram 22 % hdd 0 % on ) when first turning it on and completing the setup , windows will want to do an update and then it get 's stuck on this part .",3,2,1,5,7
2494,2494,i let it run for 8 hours and it would not finish the download as the problem is with microsoft update assistance .,3,2,1,5,7
2495,2495,so i hard shut down the computer and performed a clean boot of windows 10 from my usb flash drive and this fixed the update problem and it only took me about 20 minutes to complete the new install of windows with almost all new updates .,3,2,1,5,7
2496,2496,it only had about 6 updates to do but only took about 15 minutes to complete ) then all drivers were installed and ) two more problems caused the hdd to max out at 100 % is ( problem a ) windows store kept downloading apps that i did not wo n't and i uninstalled a couple of times but kept redownloading,3,2,1,5,7
2497,2497,so i performed a registry tweak and fixed that problem .,3,2,1,5,7
2498,2498,"( problem b ) windows superfetch , this is a known problem that has been around for many years and most people can disable it but it prevents the computer from loading programs into memory making it faster at launching those programs .",3,2,1,5,7
2499,2499,"if i wait 1-2 minutes after windows finishes booting up , superfetch will return to normal .",3,2,1,5,7
2500,2500,so i did not disable ) windows defender causes the hdd to max out at 100 % so by installing a different antivirus software fixes this problem as it will disable windows defender but you need an av that is n't a resource hog too .,3,2,1,5,7
2501,2501,"sophos , malwarebytes , comodo , bitdefender , or avast ( random order ) or all great products in protecting you and is n't a resource structure itself seems to be good .",3,2,1,5,7
2502,2502,i like how the hinges are made and hopefully they will not break like other laptops .,3,2,1,5,7
2503,2503,i am surprised how light weight this laptop is .,3,2,1,5,7
2504,2504,it does come with a side keypad and a cddvd drive which is what i wanted .,3,2,1,5,7
2505,2505,the graphic card is very good and i can play games if i want to as long as it 's not a high-end game .,3,2,1,5,7
2506,2506,the keyboard does n't have backlight which i love because it causes a glare with my eyes and i ca n't see the keys .,3,2,1,5,7
2507,2507,huge hard drive which is overkill for myself as i use local and online backup storage .,3,2,1,5,7
2508,2508,lots of ram at 8gb which i really like along with the amd a12 processor at with turbo to .,3,2,1,5,7
2509,2509,i am a fan of amd verses intel because they are cheaper but can still keep up with intel .,3,2,1,5,7
2510,2510,i did n't pay much for this laptop because it was on sale plus i used my rewards points but it was still a very good off-sale price for what it comes is my first lenovo laptop as i always bought hp in the past .,3,2,1,5,7
2511,2511,this computer is great .,3,2,1,5,7

2516,2516,"it 's not a flagship or gaming laptop but it can hold its own i run my steam games on it some at high most at medium setting and have no problem , but when it comes to gaming if it can run the sims 4 at ultra high setting it 's a winner for me .",3,2,1,5,7
2517,2517,since replacing her old laptop with this lenovo i no longer hear my wife yelling in frustration .,3,2,1,5,7
2518,2518,she is quite pleased with this one .,3,2,1,5,7

2520,2520,a task that was risky at best with the previous laptop .,3,2,1,5,7
2521,2521,i think this was a good buy for the money .,3,2,1,5,7
2522,2522,"seems very stable , i have yet to see it lock up or crash .",3,2,1,5,7
2523,2523,the keyboard is nicely arranged as well .,3,2,1,5,7

2531,2531,what i like the most is the weight and look generally .,3,2,1,5,7
2532,2532,what i dislike the most is the battery charge duration,3,2,1,5,7
2533,2533,excellent computer !,3,2,1,5,7
2534,2534,wonderful screen and works perfectly for sims 3 and 4 .,3,2,1,5,7
2535,2535,i do notice that it gets slow when you do n't update windows 10 exactly on time .,3,2,1,5,7
2536,2536,"would recommend to everyone , and is excellent for the price !",3,2,1,5,7

2538,2538,overall this is a good laptop .,3,2,1,5,7

2550,2550,"ok so this computer has 8 gb of ram and 1tb of storage to start off , and that it amazing to find anything like that under $ 800 , but yes of course this computer has some minor problems , but the problems were intentionally because they make the battery total garbage , and no backlit keyboard .",3,2,1,5,7
2551,2551,but those features were added so then people could get a good laptop for cheap .,3,2,1,5,7
2552,2552,"ive been playing video games on it , and its super smooth , even when i have multiple tabs open .",3,2,1,5,7

2562,2562,my wife is loving this .,3,2,1,5,7
2563,2563,"pros  cost bloat ram , processor , overall  less a very bright seems to be ok and one may not like front facing speakers below the noisy and fan is situated at the run review will be posted after few weeks",3,2,1,5,7
2564,2564,nice sleek look,3,2,1,5,7
2565,2565,"laptop works great , bought as a gift for my brother in law .",3,2,1,5,7
2566,2566,"here is the deal , i installed a samsung 850 pro inside the computer before i gave it to him so it is super fast .",3,2,1,5,7
2567,2567,you will be hard pressed to find any amd processors with ssds preinstalled until mobile chips become more popular .,3,2,1,5,7
2568,2568,i chose this laptop because it gave the best gaming and photoshop performance for the price and it was a high end amd processor and graphics unit .,3,2,1,5,7
2569,2569,excellent laptop for reasonable price,3,2,1,5,7
2570,2570,great laptop for budget gaming .,3,2,1,5,7
2571,2571,"works well , turns on fairly quickly .",3,2,1,5,7
2572,2572,"i would recommend disabling windows updates , getting a different antivirus and disabling windows defender .",3,2,1,5,7
2573,2573,also very important go to your battery settings and set maximum processor speed to 85 % will make sure the laptop does n't get hot and throttle itself ( slow down ) .,3,2,1,5,7
2574,2574,"it also saves a bit of all this , it plays at on a mix of med-high settings at a locked 30fps .",3,2,1,5,7
2575,2575,which isnt bad for a laptop in this price range .,3,2,1,5,7
2576,2576,"overall , impressed with it .",3,2,1,5,7
2577,2577,"works great after changing those things , would lag before .",3,2,1,5,7

2580,2580,"it took forever to open up any program , froze when i tried to search for a program , took minutes to shut down and restart , etc .",3,2,1,5,7
2581,2581,after a google search this is apparently common for this specific lenovo computer .,3,2,1,5,7
2582,2582,"i was about ready to return it , but i have a basic reset a try .",3,2,1,5,7
2583,2583,"that did n't work ( still slow clunky ) , so in one final attempt i did a full reset and with a deep erase of all data on the computer , and that finally worked !",3,2,1,5,7
2584,2584,"it seems to be acting fine for the most part computer really deserves one stall as there is no reason it should have worked that way out of the box and passed any sort of qc , but its saving grace is that with a lot of work to get it set up correctly it is actually a decent computer with great specs",3,2,1,5,7
2585,2585,thinking that with a ssd someday it will actually be pretty snappy .,3,2,1,5,7
2586,2586,so far i love it .,3,2,1,5,7
2587,2587,i play world of warcraft and it handles it great .,3,2,1,5,7

2593,2593,not sure about the negative comments on this computer i got this for $ 300.00 and i believe it is well worth the price it came with a 1tb drive and 8gb of ram ( up gradable to 16gb ) and works a treat .,3,2,1,5,7
2594,2594,it runs fallout 4 reasonable well and runs metro 2033 on high settings just fine .,3,2,1,5,7
2595,2595,no it 's not a gaming beast but for 300 it 's a steal .,3,2,1,5,7

2597,2597,very fast shipping .,3,2,1,5,7
2598,2598,sorry a few of you had .,3,2,1,5,7
2599,2599,none as yet .,3,2,1,5,7
2600,2600,great laptop for the price !,3,2,1,5,7
2601,2601,i would definitely purchase this again !,3,2,1,5,7
2602,2602,"is perfect , aesthetically beautiful , i recommend it .",3,2,1,5,7
2603,2603,its awesome in looks,3,2,1,5,7
2604,2604,great laptop for the,3,2,1,5,7
2605,2605,the wife loves it,3,2,1,5,7
2606,2606,pretty quick processor but screen is very low quality .,3,2,1,5,7
2607,2607,plastic body feels cheap .,3,2,1,5,7
2608,2608,sending mine back .,3,2,1,5,7
2609,2609,"about this product  3 star 1º if you think to use to play at would be the best choice , it is poor in usb only 2 i had to buy a usb hub .",3,2,1,5,7
2610,2610,"second ... very poor image is not so neat is just a notebook to use in light work but could play the games  fifa 16 , - low mode and medium - gt5 its a little slow - naruto storme 3 - 4 good to play - very low graphics .",3,2,1,5,7
2611,2611,"but if you need a pc just to study its good i used software like  photoshop , office , illustrator and corel its work good ...",3,2,1,5,7
2612,2612,but you if you want good image you need to connect this laptop with other monitor coz the display its very bad .,3,2,1,5,7
2613,2613,other thing this laptop it just has 1 slot to memory if you want to upgrade you need to but a ram with 16 .,3,2,1,5,7
2614,2614,after researching as much as this technically illiterate person could about the cheapest but best laptop .,3,2,1,5,7
2615,2615,this is a nice laptop for the money but i was a little disappointed in the speed of internet browsing .,3,2,1,5,7
2616,2616,for the price i think it 's one of the more powerful laptop you can buy .,3,2,1,5,7
2617,2617,the a12 9720 is definitely comparable to the intel i5 in terms of processing power .,3,2,1,5,7
2618,2618,"however , the amd radeon r7 built into this laptop beats all i5 laptops out there .",3,2,1,5,7
2619,2619,the r7 is a very capable graphics chip .,3,2,1,5,7
2620,2620,able to handle pretty high resolution graphics without lagging and slowing down the computer .,3,2,1,5,7
2621,2621,"once the r7 gets updated to the latest drivers , i noticed i am able to set my screen resolution to 1080 instead of the standard 768 .",3,2,1,5,7
2622,2622,i am not a gamer but some reviewers here have tested it on some pretty high resolution intensive games and are happy about it .,3,2,1,5,7
2623,2623,that 's really good testimony to the r7 .,3,2,1,5,7
2624,2624,with 8 gb of ram it is more than capable of handling multiple open windows and browser tabs .,3,2,1,5,7
2625,2625,a terabyte of disk storage is more than enough to save all your data .,3,2,1,5,7
2626,2626,"the entire laptop is plastic , for the price range i ca n't complain .",3,2,1,5,7
2627,2627,the battery is non-removable .,3,2,1,5,7
2628,2628,it is also very slim .,3,2,1,5,7
2629,2629,comes with a which is great .,3,2,1,5,7
2630,2630,it allows charging of devices without even turning on your laptop .,3,2,1,5,7
2631,2631,overall construction of the laptop is i do n't like about it - which is why i removed a star - the fan is extremely noisy .,3,2,1,5,7
2632,2632,the disk is also noisy .,3,2,1,5,7
2633,2633,i also prefer laptops to have removable batteries .,3,2,1,5,7
2634,2634,and to all potential buyers ... updating the laptop to windows 10 build 1709 takes a while .,3,2,1,5,7
2635,2635,so this has nothing to do with lenovo .,3,2,1,5,7
2636,2636,"be patient while it updates ; it 's , if you do not want to spend more than $ 400 on a reasonably fast and powerful laptop , anything with the amd a12 9720 with the radeon r7 gpu is a great buy at $ .",3,2,1,5,7
2637,2637,this lenovo definitely fits the bill .,3,2,1,5,7
2638,2638,everyone that 's complaining of how slow it is needs to upgrade to an ssd .,3,2,1,5,7
2639,2639,i 've upgraded my previous laptops and desktops with ssd 's but they have never been this dramatic of a overall speed increase .,3,2,1,5,7
2640,2640,this machine is lightning with one .,3,2,1,5,7
2641,2641,it 's real easy to upgrade just search google and youtube .,3,2,1,5,7
2642,2642,"the included hard drive is the slowest 5400 rpm drive you can find , it 's junk .",3,2,1,5,7
2643,2643,windows now boots in under 8 seconds .,3,2,1,5,7
2644,2644,very happy with the performance after upgrading to a relatively cheap pny ssd .,3,2,1,5,7
2645,2645,the a12 is snappy and 8gb of ram is a nice amount for windows 10 .,3,2,1,5,7
2646,2646,do yourself a favor and upgrade to an ssd immediately with the purchase of this one or you 'll hate it like some other review 's i 've seen .,3,2,1,5,7
2647,2647,"i purchased this laptop last night from best buy , it was on sale for 309 $ at this price point you can get a laptop that is touch screen but lacks good battery life or performance , you can get a laptop with bad performance and decent battery life or you can get this .",3,2,1,5,7
2648,2648,considering the price point this laptop is quit powerful .,3,2,1,5,7
2649,2649,"overall the speakers do n't sound terrible but they are down firing and do n't get super loud , the display is n't the brightest but it is definitely not dim by any means .",3,2,1,5,7
2650,2650,the colors on the display are not the best but certainly okay for the price point .,3,2,1,5,7
2651,2651,when folded open the screen does n't wobble around and overall the build quality is nice .,3,2,1,5,7
2652,2652,again considering the price point .,3,2,1,5,7
2653,2653,the keyboard definitely is n't the worst i 've used .,3,2,1,5,7
2654,2654,overall i would recommend this laptop if you 're a college student like me or if you are wanting a bigger laptop and on a budget .,3,2,1,5,7
2655,2655,overall the laptop does n't get crazy loud under load .,3,2,1,5,7
2656,2656,if battery life is a major concern this might be an issue for you .,3,2,1,5,7
2657,2657,"while listening to music with the volume around 75 % surfing the web this laptop only lasted around 3.5 hrs , battery saver is turned on about 85 % .",3,2,1,5,7
2658,2658,battery life is n't a major concern for me because im usually around an outlet .,3,2,1,5,7
2659,2659,overall this laptop is worth the price considering the pros and cons .,3,2,1,5,7
2660,2660,the biggest con is the battery life .,3,2,1,5,7
2661,2661,"i have noticed how slow the laptop may seem to be , but consider windows 10 is a big os compared to the earlier versions .",3,2,1,5,7
2662,2662,also hard drives is slower than solid state drives .,3,2,1,5,7
2663,2663,but is this bad ,3,2,1,5,7
2664,2664,not necessarily .,3,2,1,5,7
2665,2665,you have enough power to game and do light video editing .,3,2,1,5,7
2666,2666,"this is not a workstation gaming laptop costing over $ 2,000 .",3,2,1,5,7
2667,2667,"tech guys has always been iffy on amd apus but after i figure out how to keep software up-to-date , it works wonderful .",3,2,1,5,7
2668,2668,for me i love this purchase and it works for me .,3,2,1,5,7
2669,2669,"eventually i might add in an ssd and expand to 16 gb of ram but this is enough for me.so my final verdict is for someone on a budget , this is perfect for light gaming and video editing .",3,2,1,5,7
2670,2670,"for better than this , either spend more for upgrades of this laptop , or go for something dedicated to 247 heavy use .",3,2,1,5,7
2671,2671,thank you lenovo and amd .,3,2,1,5,7
2672,2672,"i am impressed for what i november 29 , 2017  my laptop froze and i know why .",3,2,1,5,7
2673,2673,windows 10 and microsoft edge was acting wonky .,3,2,1,5,7
2674,2674,so a heads up .,3,2,1,5,7
2675,2675,download current amd software and ccleaner or a better cleaner .,3,2,1,5,7
2676,2676,"after ccleaner removes temp files from microsoft edge , one day of browsing internet and 1 gigabyte of hard drive space was microsoft edge only .",3,2,1,5,7
2677,2677,"so lesson learned , always clean your pc the moment it gets slow .",3,2,1,5,7
2678,2678,"looking at it , microsoft edge and windows 10 is power hungry .",3,2,1,5,7
2679,2679,i hope windows 10 improves better in the near future .,3,2,1,5,7
2680,2680,"overall a great , fast computer , especially for the price !",3,2,1,5,7
2681,2681,"i 've only had it for a week , but i 've loaded games , music ( about 5,500 songs ) , and my .",3,2,1,5,7
2682,2682,it is still working fast and it 's not glitchy .,3,2,1,5,7
2683,2683,one thing that i do not like about it is the screen brightness when it 's not plugged in .,3,2,1,5,7
2684,2684,i have it on 100 % brightness when it 's unplugged and it 's equivalent to around 50 % brightness when it 's plugged in .,3,2,1,5,7
2685,2685,"i get it 's a good way to save battery , but i 'd like to have the choice to have full brightness and deal with having my battery die faster .",3,2,1,5,7
2686,2686,"other than that , i love it .",3,2,1,5,7
2687,2687,"and since i 'm on this thing all day for work , maybe it 's for the best that i do n't have the full power brightness on my eyes all the , it looks really sleek and is so flat !",3,2,1,5,7
2688,2688,and the finger pad is the perfect sensitivity and has the 2-finger scroll option which i love !,3,2,1,5,7
2689,2689,it 's a really great value and i would definitely recommend .,3,2,1,5,7
2690,2690,overall a great laptop for the price .,3,2,1,5,7
2691,2691,runs well without any serious lag issues .,3,2,1,5,7
2692,2692,"can run most low graphic games without real complaints i have is the keyboard is not backlit , which is annoying when using it in lowlight .",3,2,1,5,7
2693,2693,second complaint is you can not open laptop one handed .,3,2,1,5,7
2694,2694,it is so light that you pick the whole thing up instead of only lifting screen .,3,2,1,5,7
2695,2695,"seeing it in physics is better than in photos , it really is very beautiful , when you turn it on you realize the power it has , the screen is very good of the things i liked most was its full keyboard , with number keys on the right , the design allows you to have that keyboard without looking recommend",3,2,1,5,7
2696,2696,i bought this laptop for my little brother and he loves it .,3,2,1,5,7
2697,2697,"it does take a while to set up because when you first turn it on it has to upgrade , but after that , it works great .",3,2,1,5,7
2698,2698,"the laptop is aesthetically pleasing , does not look cheap and it has good response time ( meaning the time between performing an action and the computer completing it ) .",3,2,1,5,7
2699,2699,so if you 're looking for a laptop to get the job done at a resonable price this is it .,3,2,1,5,7
2700,2700,this is a great laptop for its price of $ 379.99 .,3,2,1,5,7
2701,2701,however it is even greater to buy it or $ which i did at best buy on black friday of 2017 .,3,2,1,5,7
2702,2702,it 's not a gaming laptop but it 's a great laptop for its price and it can handle pretty powerful video games but not top most powerful modern ( 2017 and later ) video are the great things about it for its tb storage gb ram graphics card for which is over 4 gb ghz fast,3,2,1,5,7
2703,2703,"everything ( in this windows 10 software ) is organized so well-it is n't heavy so it 's easier to screen is keyboard is comfortable and has the comfortable , convenient and useful numpad at the its specs it can handle all games that are not too previous laptop cost a bit under $ 400 that i 've bought in",3,2,1,5,7
2704,2704,"for $ 279.99 and even $ 379.99 , but especially the former , this is much better laptop for its including adjusted for technological differences in 2012 and really do n't see any cons ... except maybe a slightly weak battery .",3,2,1,5,7
2705,2705,but i have dealt with it by using saver mode .,3,2,1,5,7
2706,2706,on battery at that mode lasts over 3 hours ( like nearly 4 hours ) which is enough for what kinds of video games it can run  it ca n't run ni no kuni 2 but it can run naruto shippuden ultimate ninja storm 3 full burst and tales of on minimum specs .,3,2,1,5,7
2707,2707,"naruto , or both of those games , require 1 mbs dedicated video ram for recommended run but this computer has only 512 mbs dedicated video ram .",3,2,1,5,7
2708,2708,good computer for the price .,3,2,1,5,7
2709,2709,make sure you do all the software updates and install cc cleaner .,3,2,1,5,7
2710,2710,it ran slow at times but once the updates were installed it seemed to speed up .,3,2,1,5,7
2711,2711,great laptop especially for the price .,3,0,0,5,2
2712,2712,its just what i needed for now .,3,0,0,5,2
2713,2713,excellent computer for the price .,3,5,4,6,3
2714,2714,consider this recommended specs for a successful windows 10 experience in my opinion .,3,5,4,6,3
2715,2715,the hardware inside hits all the requirements for a good windows laptop without overkill parts .,3,5,4,6,3
2716,2716,"since buying this similar spec laptop with an ssd costs hundreds $ $ $ more ( something is wrong with our laptop market ) , i did a $ 60 dollar separate ssd upgrade and this machine is more than twice as fast as the original .",3,5,4,6,3
2717,2717,highly recommended for those that are capable .,3,5,4,6,3
2718,2718,i was a little scared by the previous reviews on this laptop .,3,5,4,6,3
2719,2719,but i ordered it anyway .,3,5,4,6,3
2720,2720,turns out the product is worth every penny !,3,5,4,6,3
2721,2721,i am a software developer and i have been able to run all my ides with no glitch .,3,5,4,6,3
2722,2722,i 'll definitely recommend this laptop to anyone,3,5,4,6,3
2723,2723,"excellent laptop , easy to use , run smooth and cheap .",3,5,4,6,3
2724,2724,i recommend this one .,3,5,4,6,3
2725,2725,"runs great , very fast .",3,5,4,6,3
2726,2726,good value .,3,5,4,6,3
2727,2727,"for the one star , sounds like a lemon .",3,5,4,6,3
2728,2728,i did not encounter any of the issues that was reported .,3,5,4,6,3
2729,2729,the best laptop i ever found .,3,5,4,6,3
2730,2730,this laptop is powerful enough to do anything i put it .,3,5,4,6,3
2731,2731,i can play games at high settings with no problem on some .,3,5,4,6,3
2732,2732,for example i am able to play black ops 2 at ultra settings .,3,5,4,6,3
2733,2733,great laptop for the price .,3,5,4,6,3
2734,2734,its certainly not fancy but its what inside that counts,3,5,4,6,3
2735,2735,much clearer and faster then previous laptop,3,5,4,6,3
2736,2736,bought the same model in local store this updated cpu is a quad core compared with the previous dual-core i5 .,3,5,4,6,3
2737,2737,the boosted frequency is 3.4 ghz which is amazing ! and the 12 gb ram is really really it !,3,5,4,6,3
2738,2738,"i have been using this laptop for about 6 months , and i am basically happy with it .",3,5,4,6,3
2739,2739,the one problem i have had is with the cddvd drive  it is extremely finicky to open .,3,5,4,6,3
2740,2740,i have to do this slightly frustrating thing where i push the drive further into the computer and then push the openclose toggle with one of my fingers ; sometimes it works and sometimes it does n't .,3,5,4,6,3
2741,2741,( just pushing on the toggle button without pushing in the drive does n't work at all . ),3,5,4,6,3
2742,2742,"fortunately , i do n't have to use the cddvd drive very often .",3,5,4,6,3
2743,2743,i do n't do gaming on this computer ; just basic business application stuff .,3,5,4,6,3
2744,2744,"however , i do have a lot of applications open at once , and the amount of ram seems sufficient for this  the speedperformance is fine .",3,5,4,6,3
2745,2745,i am pleased that the touchpad includes separate buttons for left and right click ( a previous version of hp computer tried to combine this into the touchpad and it was extremely frustrating and difficult to use ) .,3,5,4,6,3
2746,2746,"overall , it seems like it was a reasonably good computer with a lot of ram and large hard drive ( ) at a reasonable price ( $ 550 ) .",3,5,4,6,3
2747,2747,i must be one of the exceptions .,3,5,4,6,3
2748,2748,"this laptop , the hp series , is worth every penny .",3,5,4,6,3
2749,2749,"i have never had an hp before , but it seemed to me that the company was reputable .",3,5,4,6,3
2750,2750,"with the excellent reviews given the quad-core processor by independent testers , i gave it a try .",3,5,4,6,3
2751,2751,i am not disappointed and have not had any problems at all .,3,5,4,6,3
2752,2752,"it is extremely fast , arrived as specified , and runs like a well made swiss watch .",3,5,4,6,3
2753,2753,i have not encountered any of the problems detailed by other reviewers of the same model .,3,5,4,6,3
2754,2754,i could not complain if i wanted to .,3,5,4,6,3
2755,2755,my laptop arrived in good time and so far everything is going great !,4,4,2,6,3
2756,2756,fast running and smooth !,4,4,2,6,3

2763,2763,"good size , bright screen , sound is just now the bad !",4,4,2,6,3
2764,2764,"i purchased 2 of these laptops and 1 of them had software issues right out of the box , so i contacted hp and was told to fix this issue it would cost me a fee  ",4,4,2,6,3
2765,2765,i explained that this is brand new out of box and again they said more money ! ! !,4,4,2,6,3
2766,2766,are you kidding me ,4,4,2,6,3
2767,2767,i was told that they do not cover software only hardware !,4,4,2,6,3
2768,2768,what kind of crap is that ! !,4,4,2,6,3
2769,2769,"anyway i thought that maybe it was just a new customer service rep so i called back to see if that was indeed their policy , yes i got the same answer -- -  pay us more and we will fix your brand new computer !",4,4,2,6,3
2770,2770,hp is a joke ! ! !,4,4,2,6,3

2772,2772,this machine is well worth the money .,3,0,0,5,2
2773,2773,all new systems need to update as features and securities have evolved since the software was loaded .,3,0,0,5,2
2774,2774,how quickly this is done depends entirely on your internet connection speed .,3,0,0,5,2

2784,2784,it does come with 30 days of note  the touch pad does not have a scrolling feature .,3,0,0,5,2
2785,2785,you can set it to scroll using two fingers on the touch pad .,3,0,0,5,2

2921,2921,"this is n't a bad thing , because it also feels substantial , including the monitor hinge .",3,3,1,5,7

2926,2926,"one shocking thing to me is how well it handled running its own 1080p screen , a second 1080p screen over usb 3.0 , and a third 2560x1440 screen all at once without issue .",3,3,1,5,7

2939,2939,"it has a large bezel , which is not such a big deal .",3,3,1,5,7
2940,2940,"however , the colors are washed out and even more washed out when not looking directly at it .",3,3,1,5,7
2941,2941,"it is one of the worst screens i have seen in a long time , and the main reason for dropping my score .",3,3,1,5,7
2942,2942,"it is passable , but i would personally spend a little more for a screen with better blacks and sharper details if i was going to do a lot of writing on it .",3,3,1,5,7
2943,2943,"while people rarely use laptops outside , the screen is also not bright enough for that .",3,3,1,5,7
2944,2944,"as someone who usually cranks down the brightness to save my eyes , that aspect is fine with me.if you are going to be docking it and using standalone monitors , it supports higher resolutions is no touch screen , which i surprisingly miss because touch controls are so good in windows 10 .",3,3,1,5,7
2945,2945,"but , they are n't critical .",3,3,1,5,7
2946,2946,the keyboard has nice travel and a proper full layout .,3,3,1,5,7
2947,2947,"the trackpad is n't as responsive as a high end laptop and the clicks are n't as snappy , but it works properly and i have n't had to fight with , the long battery life is so much better than my previous laptop , whichcould last through a movie and then be done for .",3,3,1,5,7
2948,2948,this is likely due to the newest intel cpus being built for low power consumption in combination with acer 's lack of concern over a big heavy battery .,3,3,1,5,7
2949,2949,"the result is that , as long as i charge it at night , battery life just is n't a concern .",3,3,1,5,7
2950,2950,"there is even a charging port for phones or tablets that is functional with the laptop off , making this a replacement for usb charging itself could be improved , with a relatively large power brick .",3,3,1,5,7

2954,2954,"a bit of electrical tape fixes it , but i wish it was n't there to begin with .",3,3,1,5,7

2963,2963,"in testing performance , i ran a netflix movie and a show on youtube at the same time with no performance degradation .",3,3,1,5,7

2965,2965,also included is the rw dvd drive ... something becoming rare in laptops .,3,3,1,5,7
2966,2966,a nice option to watch movies if laptop display is good but has a poor viewing angle .,3,3,1,5,7
2967,2967,"i wasn ’ t surprised , my guess is that this is the display was where trade-offs were made to get the laptop to this price .",3,3,1,5,7
2968,2968,the display is hard to see from the side ( a witty salesperson would claim this is great for privacy ) and required tilting the display forwardback more than i liked to obtain the best viewing angle from the speakers surprised me .,3,3,1,5,7
2969,2969,the speaker volume is typical to most laptops in that i wish it would be about 20 % louder at max .,3,3,1,5,7
2970,2970,"the speakers seems to be nice but not amazing , at least until i was lying on a couch watching a movie with the laptop on my chest .",3,3,1,5,7
2971,2971,the nearness of my ears to the speakers allowed me to hear a very nice spacial mix of the the movie sound track `` bloomed '' at that point and was surprisingly good .,3,3,1,5,7
2972,2972,"bear in mind , i practically had to have the laptop a foot or two from my face for this to kick , for sub $ 400 , this is a very nice performing laptop .",3,3,1,5,7

2976,2976,the only thing is that pesky 5400rpm hard drive .,3,3,1,5,7
2977,2977,simply buy a 2.5 ” ssd and a sata to usb adapter .,3,3,1,5,7
2978,2978,plug the drive into the pc and use reflect to copy the drive as soon as the computer is set up .,3,3,1,5,7
2979,2979,then pop out the old drive and insert the new ssd .,3,3,1,5,7

2981,2981,even without a discreet card the graphics are impressive .,3,3,1,5,7
2982,2982,it easily outputs 4k with less than 50 % draw on integrated graphics .,3,3,1,5,7
2983,2983,although it might be limited for rendering and such .,3,3,1,5,7
2984,2984,my biggest qualm is that the older model had a backlit keyboard that was great .,3,3,1,5,7
2985,2985,i would have gladly paid 400 for this laptop if it only had that backlighting .,3,3,1,5,7

2987,2987,"for its price , one of the best option out there .",3,3,1,5,7
2988,2988,what concerns me are the cramped keyboard layout and sturdiness of its screen cover .,3,3,1,5,7

3002,3002,the battery life is excellent and it was almost entirely clear from the random crap most big box retailers slam into their off the shelf machines ( removed the antivirus included as it does n't hold a candle to avast ) major complaint thought is the trackpad .,3,3,1,5,7
3003,3003,i really wish there were buttons on it instead of a click of the right or left side of the pad .,3,3,1,5,7

3021,3021,"fortunately , the laptop is designed to make both of those components easily replaced the hdd with an ssd and upgraded the ram to an 8gb dual-channel kit .",3,3,1,5,7

3027,3027,"of course , ubuntu on an ssd is a very different setup from the laptop as shipped , so i really ca n't say what the user experience of windows 10 on the hdd would be others have commented , the screen is not the best , but it is good enough if you 're not doing graphic design or gaming .",3,3,1,5,7

3031,3031,"not the fastest pc around , but at this price you ca n't expect it to be .",3,3,1,5,7

3058,3058,acer 's tech support 's only advice was to reset the computer to the original os to fix the problem .,3,3,1,5,7

3175,3175,"definitely not a high end laptop , but will get the job done for work or for a college student in a non-technical major , and appears much more durable and robust than some of the `` sleeker '' models on sale in stores next to it .",3,3,1,5,7

3195,3195,the plastic build is sturdy enough to last for a decent amount if taken care of biggest complaint is that you can not remove the battery .,3,3,1,5,7
3196,3196,"once the battery starts to go , you ca n't replace it .",3,3,1,5,7
3197,3197,"unless you can take apart the entire laptop and replace the battery cells yourself , you would have to purchase another sure how universal this issue is but the speakers on mine are compared to other similar laptops from other manufacturers so be wary of that .",3,3,1,5,7

3201,3201,i bought this as a cheap replacement for a previous tablet that i lost .,0,9,0,4,7
3202,3202,"i 'll start by saying i use this primarily to watch movies on airplanes and to surf the net , so if you 're looking for a review on how this handles intensive gaming , this is n't out of the box , this thing will need a windows 10 update .",0,9,0,4,7
3203,3203,be prepared to give it at least 24 hours to go through the entire update .,0,9,0,4,7
3204,3204,"this is n't a fault of the device , but it 's slightly annoying if you thought you could just fire this thing up and get started .",0,9,0,4,7
3205,3205,"do yourself a favor and get started on it as soon as you take it out of the box , plug it in , and connect to the internet .",0,9,0,4,7

3208,3208,"a big plus for my usage is that it fits perfectly on an airplane seatback tray table and still leaves room for a drink , especially when you detach the keyboard and leave it in your bag ( no need for it unless you 're typing , but the screen can double for that purpose if you do n't have a lot of typing",0,9,0,4,7
3209,3209,"the keyboard itself is very sturdy and does n't feel cheap at all and provides a nice , protective cover when attached and folded .",0,9,0,4,7

3211,3211,no added a micro sd card with 64 gb to expand the storage and the pics i had we 're crystal clear .,0,9,0,4,7
3212,3212,"in fact , the images were better and had more depth and contrast than when i view them on my 23 ' desktop .",0,9,0,4,7
3213,3213,the front facing camera is about what you would expect for a device in this price range and the microphone picks up sound pretty well when you 're speaking within 4 to 5 feet of the screen .,0,9,0,4,7
3214,3214,i can skype with my kids without much issue and i prefer using this for video chatting over using a phone because i can see their faces better on this bigger screen .,0,9,0,4,7
3215,3215,"if you 're thinking of using this for business video conferencing , there are probably better quality options for you.the one downside of this ( so far ) is the sound produced by the device itself .",0,9,0,4,7
3216,3216,"the speaker is pretty awful if you try to listen to it straight from the device and can only be described as `` tinny '' and it is definitely monotone , not stereo .",0,9,0,4,7
3217,3217,i connected my bluetooth headphones to this device and the sound was good that way .,0,9,0,4,7
3218,3218,"if you 're thinking you can lie around in bed and watch stuff with this , i would recommend headphones otherwise you 'll miss out on a lot of background stuff due to the low fidelity of this thing .",0,9,0,4,7

3295,3295,no idea why .,3,2,2,5,0
3296,3296,"despite the comment below , i had it on a laptop cooler and i was n't doing anything that would generate heat when it blew out .",3,2,2,5,0
3297,3297,"research revealed that this was not a common problem with these machines , so i 'm guessing i got one that just had something go wrong with it ( not the first time that 's ever happened to me ) sent it back to amazon , got a refund and then bought another one .",3,2,2,5,0
3298,3298,so far so good .,3,2,2,5,0
3299,3299,"i liked the laptop enough to warrant purchasing another one , so i thought it only fair that i revise my rating .",3,2,2,5,0
3300,3300,"providing this one does n't blow out on me in a couple of weeks , i see no reason not to rate it 5-stars ( original rating had been 3-stars ) 's an amazing little machine that runs everything i throw at review  a great laptop , but it stopped working completely after about three and a half weeks of use",3,2,2,5,0
3301,3301,it shut down while i was doing light work ( nothing that would generate any major heat ) and then never came on again .,3,2,2,5,0

3306,3306,good luck with your purchase .,3,2,2,5,0
3307,3307,i had to return mine .,3,2,2,5,0
3308,3308,"ok , for anyone buying this laptop , i have to say that this is a great budget laptop .",3,2,2,5,0
3309,3309,for 800 bucks it runs almost every game you 'd want to play on high quality and 60fps ( games that are n't extremely graphics intensive ) .,3,2,2,5,0
3310,3310,"but , a lot of people complain that the computer is slow ( and so did i at first ) .",3,2,2,5,0
3311,3311,it turns out that you just need to disable a lot of the startup bloatware and useless microsoft services .,3,2,2,5,0
3312,3312,"once you do , it 'll run a lot faster .",3,2,2,5,0
3313,3313,just make sure that you have it plugged in to charge when gaming or else you 'll experience frame drops and quality decrease .,3,2,2,5,0
3314,3314,"other than the initial problems , this laptop is great !",3,2,2,5,0
3315,3315,"i bought this laptop ( ram , i5 ) a few weeks ago , shipped really fast ! , when i got this laptop i encountered a problem on the disk hard drive , it was always about 100 % , i spoke with dell 's customer service and their employee gave an excellent attitude and fixed the problem in a few seconds",3,2,2,5,0
3316,3316,i like this laptop .,3,2,2,5,0
3317,3317,upgraded from a dell which is a $ 250 laptop so its a huge step up for me though it still a plastic laptop so you probably should expect small cracks on the side of the laptop that does n't effect the usability and is n't noticeable .,3,2,2,5,0
3318,3318,to help avoid this recommend getting a poly carbonate shell to give you laptop more protection .,3,2,2,5,0
3319,3319,i like that the laptop has a full hd panel but the tn display make colors look much worse when compared to ips but its overall is fine if you never used an ips screen ( the difference is considerable ) .,3,2,2,5,0
3320,3320,sound is good and the underside sub woofer makes listening to music a lot more immersive .,3,2,2,5,0
3321,3321,3 usb 3.0 ports is n't enough for me i need at least 4 since one port is always occupied with a wireless mouse receiver i also need a port to charge my mouse and a port for a external hdd which means i always need to unplug one of these things if want to use another usb .,3,2,2,5,0
3322,3322,the hdd version i have is way too slow for 2018 standards and i think ssd 's are close to becoming the standard for laptops .,3,2,2,5,0
3323,3323,keyboard and track pad are good so no worries unless your not used having a numpad to the right of the keyboard which requires you to slightly disposition your hands from the center of the laptop to the left which is slightly uncomfortable if you want to type papers .,3,2,2,5,0
3324,3324,i usually keep my laptop on my desk since i 've seen pictures of the 7559 ( which has the same body as this laptop ) being completely destroyed because of the hinge defect on these laptops .,3,2,2,5,0
3325,3325,at first i was worried that this might happen to me but its been over 2 months since i bought this so my fears have settled but you should still be careful to not drop this laptop cause it will probably break unless you get the poly carbonate shell which will make this laptop stronger .,3,2,2,5,0
3326,3326,the gaming side of this laptop is fine and the fans do get noisy when your gaming but its drowned out by the games so i really notice most of the of right now dell released the new g series gaming laptops which start at $ 750 which is 100 dollars more but the quality is bound to be improved and it has,3,2,2,5,0
3327,3327,for example ssd is 5 times faster then hdd and ssd is 5 times faster then a though ssd 's are much more expensive but will get cheaper in the future so you can always buy one separately and add it in yourself since dell gaming laptops are easy to upgraded hardware on the g3 means,3,2,2,5,0

3376,3376,i find ( switch to it from a high quality touch screen ) that yes it is lacking a bit however as for as display quality i believe the issue lies more in the defult contrast and color settings .,3,2,2,5,0

3751,3752,"the only problem that i have found about lenovo is that it comes with a program called migration , which is supposed to migrate your things from your old computer to your new computer .",3,1,2,5,6

3768,3769,charging takes a while you ’ d have to keep it plugged in for at least an hour or two to get it fully ’ m assuming the battery wasn ’ t designed to handle the laptop being as though it ’ s got a quad core processor and good amount of ram .,3,1,2,5,6
3769,3770,"guess they had to cut the costs somewhere ... lucky for me i don ’ t use it all that much , just got it to do some work when not at the office , less than an hour a day of usage .",3,1,2,5,6

3776,3777,ca n't run windows mixed reality due to insufficient memory .,4,6,1,5,3

3779,3780,i love just about everything about this laptop .,4,6,1,5,3
3780,3781,my only negative comment about it is the speakers .,4,6,1,5,3
3781,3782,they are on the bottom of the laptop .,4,6,1,5,3
3782,3783,i have to turn the volume almost all the way to the max level just to hear anything .,4,6,1,5,3
3783,3784,i do n't understand why the speakers are under the computer when they could have easily been put above the keyboard .,4,6,1,5,3
3784,3785,i love the huge screen and i also like the number pad on the keyboard .,4,6,1,5,3
3785,3786,the only thing that would make this laptop better would be a lit keyboard .,4,6,1,5,3

3909,3910,i decided to buy another hp to replace my current hp .,2,6,3,5,3
3910,3911,when i started looking for a computer i was looking at metal chassis machines for durability .,2,6,3,5,3
3911,3912,"i travel a lot and use my computer on planes , trains , in coffee shops , malls , and sometimes in my office .",2,6,3,5,3
3912,3913,i have had my current hp for 7 years and it has always performed nicely .,2,6,3,5,3
3913,3914,i bought a lenovo 3 years ago as a replacement because my hp was starting to slow down and i am impatient .,2,6,3,5,3
3914,3915,the screen developed a line across it just after a year .,2,6,3,5,3
3915,3916,multiple screws fell out of the case and it started getting buggy .,2,6,3,5,3
3916,3917,i switched back to my hp and it performed without any problems .,2,6,3,5,3
3917,3918,the more i researched the more i went back to i received the package the outer box was undamaged but the original box the computer was packed in had significant damage and my first thought was i had to return it .,2,6,3,5,3
3918,3919,the second thought was why would they ship a computer in a box with that much damage .,2,6,3,5,3
3919,3920,i took pictures and prepared to return the computer .,2,6,3,5,3
3920,3921,i travel a lot for work and do not spend much time in the united states and the next time i will be in the country is in june of 2018 so i thought if the computer works and is not damaged i will keep it .,2,6,3,5,3
3921,3922,i took the computer out of the packaging and there were no visible signs of damage .,2,6,3,5,3
3922,3923,i plugged it in and started it up and everything worked just like it should .,2,6,3,5,3
3923,3924,everything is tight with no computer is light and looks like it has a metal chassis .,2,6,3,5,3
3924,3925,it feels solid and not flimsy like some other brands .,2,6,3,5,3
3925,3926,about 2 hours after i finished setting it up i stepped outside for a minute and my granddaughter pulled the computer off the table onto the hardwood floor .,2,6,3,5,3
3926,3927,she did not get hit with the computer and my wife quickly moved her to another room and picked up my computer .,2,6,3,5,3
3927,3928,she was afraid it was broken .,2,6,3,5,3
3928,3929,after looking the computer over the only damage is to one of the corners .,2,6,3,5,3
3929,3930,"the computer is still solid , and works just fine .",2,6,3,5,3
3930,3931,i am very happy with it and will look at hp again next time i buy a timed the battery life and with normal use with no gaming and only light video streaming it lasted more than 8 hours .,2,6,3,5,3
3931,3932,i expect the time to go down some over time but if i get half the performance i got out of my old hp i expect the battery to last during most of my out of office time and during all but the longest only gave 4 stars because the damage done to the box .,2,6,3,5,3
3932,3933,there were three items in the amazon box when it arrived and this one was in the middle so it was not damaged in transit .,2,6,3,5,3
3933,3934,it had to be damaged prior to shipping .,2,6,3,5,3
3934,3935,this computer is sleek in design and very compact .,2,6,3,5,3
3935,3936,it ’ s everything i needed it to be .,2,6,3,5,3
3936,3937,"i have an ethernet port , micro sd port , and more than enough usb ports .",2,6,3,5,3
3937,3938,"for a small computer , it ’ s more than i expected and it runs excellent .",2,6,3,5,3
3938,3939,the i7 is also a big plus !,2,6,3,5,3
3939,3940,thanks hp !,2,6,3,5,3
3940,3941,it 's very nice looking computer .,2,6,3,5,3
3941,3942,the screen is sharp and the back lit keys are nice .,2,6,3,5,3
3942,3943,it came with allot of bloatware .,2,6,3,5,3
3943,3944,it periodically freezes upand sometimes loads slow .,2,6,3,5,3
3944,3945,i never know when this is going to,2,6,3,5,3
3945,3946,it 's really a problem when i have to write an email report for my work and it does this .,2,6,3,5,3
3946,3947,"if i ca n't send a simple email when i need to , what good is it .",2,6,3,5,3
3947,3948,i do n't think i can send this back .,2,6,3,5,3
3948,3949,i 'm just sick about it .,2,6,3,5,3
3949,3950,"my advise is , buy a dell .",2,6,3,5,3
3950,3951,"this computer arrived promptly , the box was in excellent condition .",2,6,3,5,3
3951,3952,"i upon opening and turning on the computer for the first time , i had just over 80 % battery life left for operating .",2,6,3,5,3
3952,3953,i noticed that this computer was not exactly crisp with moving window to window and transitioning from one program to another .,2,6,3,5,3
3953,3954,"i need this to multi task for school and although this does the job , i am sad to say it is n't as quick as i was hoping for .",2,6,3,5,3
3954,3955,for a few hours everything and then windows and other updates were prompting .,2,6,3,5,3
3955,3956,i started to update programs and had an error with hp accelerometer program .,2,6,3,5,3
3956,3957,i successfully deleted the program restarted the computer and reinstalled a newer driver edition .,2,6,3,5,3
3957,3958,now everything is running without any battery life is very disappointing and the fact that hp states 9hrs of operating is just crazy .,2,6,3,5,3
3958,3959,"i have on a full charge been lucky to get 4.5 without the backlit keyboard and with power saving options i do recommend this computer if you are in need of something that is very light weight and easy to carry around , just make sure to bring your charger .",2,6,3,5,3
3959,3960,i like how it does n't contain a lot of bloatware that all too many computers to date seem to provide .,2,6,3,5,3
3960,3961,"first , the keyboard is backlit .",2,6,3,5,3
3961,3962,press the f5 key and there you go .,2,6,3,5,3
3962,3963,"honestly , this is a superb laptop , especially for me .",2,6,3,5,3
3963,3964,"it 's fairly light weight , very easy to use , more storage than just about any human could use , a lot of great features .",2,6,3,5,3
3964,3965,i would have loved to own this thing five years ago .,2,6,3,5,3
3965,3966,there 's nothing cheap or flimsy about it .,2,6,3,5,3
3966,3967,"i read other reviews about a noisy fan , but i 'm not hearing it and my hearing is very good .",2,6,3,5,3
3967,3968,maybe it was a later improvement on the model ,2,6,3,5,3
3968,3969,"i do n't know , but this thing is as silent as it gets .",2,6,3,5,3
3969,3970,"seriously , this is a very nice computer .",2,6,3,5,3
3970,3971,"yes , there is no dvd drive , but you can buy one to usb attach for less than $ 40 , so that should n't be too big of a deal .",2,6,3,5,3
3971,3972,"and , oh yeah , a very good keyboard .",2,6,3,5,3
3972,3973,excellent key feel makes typing very comfortable .,2,6,3,5,3
3973,3974,i 've been using this laptop for a little over a month now and i 'm satisfied .,2,6,3,5,3
3974,3975,my biggest concern when choosing to buy another hp pavilion was with overheating but this model stays cool .,2,6,3,5,3
3975,3976,i love how sleek and light it is and even with all the bloatware it boots quickly .,2,6,3,5,3
3976,3977,i gave it 4 stars because the battery life is n't as long as i would like but it really is n't bad .,2,6,3,5,3
3977,3978,was n't standard silver like in the photo but more a goldish threw me far so good .,2,6,3,5,3
3978,3979,i love the keyboard .,2,6,3,5,3
3979,3980,speaker volume is ok as well so far for the purpose .,2,6,3,5,3
3980,3981,"very good item , sleek easy to use , very light .",2,6,3,5,3
3981,3982,"design is very side bit slow for an i5 from the beginning , also there is this irritating hard disk spinning noise ( like its out of place ) .",2,6,3,5,3
3982,3983,it ’ s pertinent with all of these model not just with mine that ’ s how it ’ s manufactured i checked it and even other reviews say backup is not as expected i think it doesn ’ t even last of what is claimed .,2,6,3,5,3
3983,3984,this laptop is gorgeous !,2,6,3,5,3
3984,3985,"hp should advertise this hidden gem more , it 's a handsome laptop with competitive specs , and a budget price .",2,6,3,5,3

4005,4006,"lag was down right annoying in bad  i had purchased this based on the empty ssd slot for an extra drive ; however , the slot is not supported with the bios that asus has loaded on the mb .",3,7,2,5,1
4006,4007,"when i contact asus , i got mixed results .",3,7,2,5,1
4007,4008,"but when it was clear to them i was wanting to use the slot , it became all use a professional certified upgrader ' , etc .",3,7,2,5,1
4008,4009,further help was cut off .,3,7,2,5,1
4009,4010,"this is why i 'm docking on tips online and some guidance from asus , i tried reinstalling on the hd with no noticable improvment .",3,7,2,5,1
4010,4011,ultimately ended up installing a 2.5 '' ssd and reinstalling as it was past the return period and all the troubleshooting i had done pretty much blocked a return good  empty memory slot makes it easy to double ram to 16gb .,3,7,2,5,1
4011,4012,"and i had no issues with ram support was good on helping with a track pad issue ( bios update ) and which 2.5 '' ssd 's could be the new 2.5 '' ssd and freshly installed , this is a great laptop .",3,7,2,5,1

4016,4017,"lr burned through a charge in  2 hours , but it 's lr , right ",3,7,2,5,1
4017,4018,no issues with heat build up .,3,7,2,5,1
4018,4019,"unit runs cool , even in lr .",3,7,2,5,1
4019,4020,i am going to try loading up a few games to see how they unit is not bulky due to the thin bezel around the screen .,3,7,2,5,1
4020,4021,"it feels more like a 14 '' computer , but the screen view is ' .",3,7,2,5,1
4021,4022,the graphics look nice for a laptop and definitely top-notch in this price range .,3,7,2,5,1
4022,4023,the case feels a little flimsy .,3,7,2,5,1
4023,4024,"opening things up , it is clear there is not much stiffening material in the .",3,7,2,5,1
4024,4025,but i am not hard on my electronics ( i do n't expect them to survive a two-story drop unharmed ) .,3,7,2,5,1
4025,4026,i do not expect to have issues beyond normal wear .,3,7,2,5,1
4026,4027,"the weight is light enought that i would compare it to the mac it is replacing ( yes , i went apple for a bit , but i 'm back folks ! ) .",3,7,2,5,1
4027,4028,the small charger unit is a bonus too .,3,7,2,5,1

4029,4030,"but with the ssd and a stick of memory , this is a great laptop for the money .",3,7,2,5,1
4030,4031,advice to potential buyers  go ahead and get the ssd version .,3,7,2,5,1
4031,4032,surprisingly well optioned for the price .,3,7,2,5,1

4035,4036,only draw back is that the power button is located right next to the delete button .,3,7,2,5,1
4036,4037,it is annoying when typing and you accidentally hit the power button .,3,7,2,5,1
4037,4038,"other than that little complaint , love working on this machine .",3,7,2,5,1

4057,4058,it even has an automatic installment of windows and there was like a bot that recognizes my voice the first to help me with the installation of the windows .,3,7,2,5,1
4058,4059,i thought its gon na be hard to use the windows 10 but i was mistaken .,3,7,2,5,1
4059,4060,it can also sustain a gameplay especially in thing that disappointed me was the longetivity of the battery which was stated like `` 8h battery life ( full working day ) '' but the charge is only lasting for 4hrs .,3,7,2,5,1
4060,4061,"note  the battery is not the way , i appreciated amazon in giving back the express fee i spent for this , since it had a delay in the delivery .",3,7,2,5,1

4070,4071,"i didn ’ t believe other customers complaning about windows taking forever to update ; it took over 10 hours ( i went to sleep , so it could be more time ) to complete the update , recommendation downlod the iso file from microsoft a lightweight and great laptop ; second recommendation upgrade to ssd , i also bought the crucial micron",3,7,2,5,1
4071,4072,i 'll never go back to anything less than i7 processor and a ssd .,3,7,2,5,1

4076,4077,i do wish asus was clearer about which computers use which chargers as i always buy a backup charger for home use .,3,7,2,5,1
4077,4078,"it 's tough to match from the item description , but i found one for this .",3,7,2,5,1

4082,4083,"runs great , has a cheap feel but that should be expected at this price considering the quality of the internals .",3,7,2,5,1
4083,4084,my only real gripe is the size of the right shift button and placement of the up arrow key .,3,7,2,5,1
4084,4085,i work with all day and i 've accidentally clicked the up arrow when going for the shift key quite often .,3,7,2,5,1
4085,4086,"other than the very poor placement of the up key , this is a very quality machine at this price note is the screen is n't a bright and glossy screen like most but i prefer that .",3,7,2,5,1

4090,4091,i love the asus brand and this computer is also well spec 'd .,3,7,2,5,1
4091,4092,the bad rating goes to amazon as they say windows 10 which i assume meant windows 10 pro as all the other ones on the comparison table stated windows 10 home .,3,7,2,5,1
4092,4093,i now have a windows 10 home addition for a business and will need to pay another huge sum for windows 10 pro .,3,7,2,5,1

4103,4104,i ’ ve never written a negative review like this so take it with a grain of salt ...,3,7,2,5,1
4104,4105,i opened the box and setup this laptop and couldn ’ t be less impressed .,3,7,2,5,1
4105,4106,"to be fair , i ’ m going from a lenovo yoga 900 series that start at twice as much ( broken charging port , risky and cost prohibitive to have repaired ) .",3,7,2,5,1
4106,4107,this doesn ’ t feel light as it says at all to me .,3,7,2,5,1
4107,4108,i was sure even without adding ssd storage the processor would be impressive .,3,7,2,5,1
4108,4109,nope .,3,7,2,5,1
4109,4110,i ’ ve never owned an asus and i ’ m not impressed with what i consider flaws .,3,7,2,5,1

4111,4112,"for the money it ’ s probably amazing , but i don ’ t think it will blow anyone away by any means .",3,7,2,5,1
4112,4113,"loud fan noise , i7 works like i3 ( idk why ) , great display , sleek a normal laptop with i7 and is wow only because of the nano edge tasking a bit slow .",3,7,2,5,1

4247,4248,"no , it was not fan noise , it was electrical noise ( coil whine i believe ) and very noticeable in a quiet room .",2,0,5,2,3
4248,4249,returned this one and ordered a second one - hopefully it will not be defective - i 'll update my review when i receive than the electrical noise defect i am very excited about this laptop .,2,0,5,2,3
4249,4250,"i also have the asus which is very nice , and compared to that one the is slightly heavier and slightly thicker , almost unnoticeable .",2,0,5,2,3

4256,4257,"i do n't know if i can bare to give it a 3rd try , but it 's hard to find these same specs for the price anywhere the seller please comment on this issue and help me out ",2,0,5,2,3
4257,4258,decided to order a 3rd unit but this time i went for a slightly different model ( the one with the 7th gen processor and the graphics card ) and the coil whine problem is gone !,2,0,5,2,3
4258,4259,"well , mostly - it is unnoticeable but if i hold my ear to the upper left corner i can maybe faintly hear it when it is working hard .",2,0,5,2,3
4259,4260,ca n't even hear it at a normal usage distance with it on my lap .,2,0,5,2,3
4260,4261,"so i 'm keeping this one , but before you run off and buy the note that this model does not have as good battery life as the due to the graphics card .",2,0,5,2,3
4261,4262,"i 'm getting maybe 5-6hrs with light usage , i was hoping for better .",2,0,5,2,3

4264,4265,"the coil whine tremendously by setting my wallpaper to solid black , and changing battery settings from ' to ' ; it still screeches from time to time but it 's not as loud as it was before .",2,0,5,2,3
4265,4266,"hope it helped you ! it 's an amazing laptop , beautiful and very powerful for how thin it is .",2,0,5,2,3
4266,4267,i use it for music production via fruity loops and some light gaming like cs  go and lol .,2,0,5,2,3
4267,4268,the only problem i have with it is the extremely loud coil whine .,2,0,5,2,3
4268,4269,it got to the point where it annoys the hell out of me .,2,0,5,2,3
4269,4270,i can hear it even if i 'm playing music fairly loud or have a lot of background noise going on .,2,0,5,2,3
4270,4271,wish there was a fix for otherwise it would 've definitely been a i ca n't stand the coil whine .,2,0,5,2,3
4271,4272,nasty screeching staticy noise even while just web browsing .,2,0,5,2,3
4272,4273,it 's not the fan ; top left of the it freezing at times randomly in applications as well .,2,0,5,2,3
4273,4274,would return it but i do n't have the time to wait because of work and school .,2,0,5,2,3
4274,4275,"wish i went with something if it were n't for the noise , this would be perfect .",2,0,5,2,3
4275,4276,exterior quality is superior along with a very nice display .,2,0,5,2,3
4276,4277,pretty sturdy keyboard  fixed ... kinda,2,0,5,2,3
4277,4278,"unfortunately , it seems this laptop suffers from the typical quality control unit i received is clearly defective .",2,0,5,2,3
4278,4279,fist thing i noticed  there is some pretty bad blacklight bleed on the screen .,2,0,5,2,3
4279,4280,the processor also makes a very loud and unsettling electrical sizzling noise .,2,0,5,2,3
4280,4281,it can be heard all the way across my living room when the computer is just idling on the desktop .,2,0,5,2,3
4281,4282,"it gets even louder the more you stress the processor , and it 's a very high pitched whine .",2,0,5,2,3
4282,4283,"if you have high frequency hearing loss you may not even hear it , but for me its have monitored the temps on the cpu while doing various tasks with the computer .",2,0,5,2,3
4283,4284,"doing anything more than web browsing makes the temps jump above 70c , and the fan is constantly kept testing out the laptop to try and figure out what was up , and in the process i got several bsods , and the battery strangely went from 74 % to 0 % while the laptop was just sitting on my desk for a",2,0,5,2,3

4287,4288,i am truly hoping that i can get a working replacement and can update my review .,2,0,5,2,3

4289,4290,the screen looks really good even at 1080p resolution .,2,0,5,2,3
4290,4291,the feel and weight of the laptop feels sleek and clean .,2,0,5,2,3
4291,4292,"the track pad feel is average but the tactility of the clicks are very nice and , this laptop is n't perfect .",2,0,5,2,3
4292,4293,the keyboard is extremely mushy and subpar .,2,0,5,2,3
4293,4294,having the power button on the top right corner does n't help either .,2,0,5,2,3
4294,4295,"and the worst part is definitely the loud and distinctive could for me , the specs and price of the laptop makes up for the downsides .",2,0,5,2,3

4299,4300,fast and trouble-free .,2,0,5,2,3
4300,4301,minimal bloatware .,2,0,5,2,3
4301,4302,my only criticisms are a power button that is overly easy to activate ( would prefer having to hold it down for a second ) and a fairly dim display even on full brightness .,2,0,5,2,3
4302,4303,"would recommend , if it fits your budget .",2,0,5,2,3
4303,4304,i bought this laptop for linux ( solus ) .,2,0,5,2,3
4304,4305,everything works great for my needs .,2,0,5,2,3
4305,4306,"the ambient light sensor and fingerprint readers need additional drivers that i have n't installed ( because i do n't want those features ) , but the rest of the hardware works perfectly on a default install .",2,0,5,2,3
4306,4307,i installed tlp and and i 'm getting the stated 9hrs of battery life with moderate usage .,2,0,5,2,3
4307,4308,"additionally , this laptop does n't include some of the things that do n't play well with linux yet , such as mode , touch screen , and 4k resolution .",2,0,5,2,3
4308,4309,honestly could n't be happier with it as a replacement for my macbook  out of the box you have to do a few things to be able to enter the bios so you can disable secure boot and tweak the boot manager to boot to your linux install .,2,0,5,2,3
4309,4310,"amazon wo n't let me post links to that info in this review , but you can find it with a little note  i did n't hear the fan `` whine '' as others have reported .",2,0,5,2,3
4310,4311,based on everything i 've read this was a windows specific problem that was fixed in later software updates .,2,0,5,2,3
4311,4312,love this laptop .,2,0,5,2,3
4312,4313,i 'm so sad to see the newer gen laptops that have removed the microsd card reader and all the `` normal '' usb ports .,2,0,5,2,3
4313,4314,this laptop has been rock solid .,2,0,5,2,3
4314,4315,i 'm running linux mint on it and it works perfectly .,2,0,5,2,3
4315,4316,"the keyboard is perfect - especially the arrow keys ( the newer models cram the four arrow keys together in a very way , but this model has a great keyboard . )",2,0,5,2,3
4316,4317,the matte screen is exactly what i wanted .,2,0,5,2,3
4317,4318,"i absolutely did n't want a touch screen , they waste battery and you end up with a screen covered in fingerprints and one that reflects everything behind you , making it difficult to get work in all , this was a great purchase .",2,0,5,2,3
4318,4319,thank you asus for providing a great laptop for linux users !,2,0,5,2,3
4319,4320,this is my first asus .,2,0,5,2,3
4320,4321,i was toshiba lover and also worked with dell and lenovo provided by my company .,2,0,5,2,3
4321,4322,"i do basic tasks in this laptop ( office , google docs , working online ) and works great .",2,0,5,2,3
4322,4323,i found this lt very reliable and easy to carry everywhere .,2,0,5,2,3
4323,4324,"there are things like the number of ports available , but i was aware when i choose it.not missing toshiba at all .",2,0,5,2,3
4324,4325,"impressed with the portability , the display , battery life and performance of this ultrabook .",2,0,5,2,3
4325,4326,"but my concerns about asus ' quality control remain  the computer has a noticeable coil whine emanating from the top left corner of the base ( near where the escape key is ) , and the notebook has a serious chassis flex problem .",2,0,5,2,3
4326,4327,"the unit i have got delivered with a keyboard that is somewhat ( by atleast 1 mm ) recessed into the chassis near the keys owing to the aluminum chassis having coil whine problem is not that serious on my unit , but to pay a $ 1,000 to have a notebook delivered with a bent chassis has been disappointing to say",2,0,5,2,3
4327,4328,did not have any issues with quality of product .,2,0,5,2,3
4328,4329,"booted up very nicely , no fan or hardware noises .",2,0,5,2,3
4329,4330,windows 10 prompts easy to follow and computer was ready very you 're looking for something for school or light office work then this is a very good laptop .,2,0,5,2,3
4330,4331,so far this laptop has completely met my expectations .,2,0,5,2,3
4331,4332,"extremely light yet feels rigid enough , loads all my 3d design software fast and nice .",2,0,5,2,3
4332,4333,graphics could be faster ... but not for this price tag !,2,0,5,2,3
4333,4334,"i love windows 10 , and particularly the fact it is not windows 8 ... the only but i find it that when plugged it generates that weird electric field around the keyboard and behind the screen that you feel when you pass your finger or hand .",2,0,5,2,3
4334,4335,"it is strange , i guess it is because there is no ground on the power supply ",2,0,5,2,3
4335,4336,"i ’ ve been waiting for this version ( the ) since it ’ s updated with intel ’ s 8th gen low-power cores , which for the first time are quad rather than dual core .",2,0,5,2,3
4336,4337,"so it was definitely worth waiting a couple of months for , this is a great laptop – i love it .",2,0,5,2,3
4337,4338,"the 14 ” screen is beautiful , with plenty of brightness , and it ’ s matte which is my preference .",2,0,5,2,3
4338,4339,"it ’ s not touch-enabled , which might be a dealbreaker for some , but i don ’ t see the point in touch screens on laptops anyway , and i detest their glossy reflections .",2,0,5,2,3
4339,4340,it does use pwm to modify brightness however ; which should n't affect the majority of users but some might get eyestrain or headaches .,2,0,5,2,3
4340,4341,"it does n't affect me personally so it 's fine , and a lot of modern screens use pwm so it can be difficult to , build quality is pretty good .",2,0,5,2,3
4341,4342,"there is a tiny flex in the metal surrounding the keypads , and again in the lid , but it ’ s negligible and barely noticeable and certainly shouldn ’ t impact reviews have noted the cooling performance , and yes , the fans do start up when doing cpu intensive tasks .",2,0,5,2,3
4342,4343,"some people have installed notebook fan control to increase the heat threshold at which the fan operates , but i haven ’ t since it doesn ’ t really bother me – with normal usage , i certainly can ’ t hear it over other background noises coming in from fridge .",2,0,5,2,3
4343,4344,"it ’ s noticeable when it is under stress , but that tends to only be when i ’ m doing some light gaming and i ’ ll either have headphones in or music playing .",2,0,5,2,3
4344,4345,"on the whole , i ’ d rather the fan switches on to keep the cpu cool than to have it heat up more but be fingerprint sensor is a useful feature to have – it saves a couple of seconds logging in .",2,0,5,2,3
4345,4346,"scanning accuracy isn ’ t always great , though , and i ’ ve added 3 different profiles of the same finger to ensure it always recognises me – ie with finger , wet shrivelled finger from the shower and a ‘ normal ’ one .",2,0,5,2,3
4346,4347,"this seems to work , though you do need to add slight pressure when using it or it doesn ’ t recognise the whole this is a great laptop , very good value for money as asus almost always is .",2,0,5,2,3
4347,4348,"don ’ t let the negative reviews put you off  they seem to have defective units or subjective problems with the device – i like the circular shine effect on the lid , it ’ s simple yet classy .",2,0,5,2,3
4348,4349,i connect this to my tv via hdmi and use a wireless keyboard and mouse while at home .,2,0,5,2,3
4349,4350,it works great to view streaming video .,2,0,5,2,3
4350,4351,it is very slim and will be easy to travel with .,2,0,5,2,3
4351,4352,it is great for everything i do except play games on high settings .,2,0,5,2,3
4352,4353,real good value for money .,2,0,5,2,3
4353,4354,the system breezes through most developer tasks and is very portable and cool .,2,0,5,2,3
4354,4355,battery life is decent too .,2,0,5,2,3
4355,4356,boot times are is comparable to 7th gen hq processors .,2,0,5,2,3
4356,4357,thats a huge step-up for a u processor .,2,0,5,2,3
4357,4358,"if you are buying a laptop in 2018 and are conscious of the budget , definitely give this a look .",2,0,5,2,3
4358,4359,'ve added an update to the review at the of all this laptop has great value for price which is tough to match for any other brand on the market .,2,0,5,2,3
4359,4360,most people mentioned this but i think it needs to be emphasized .,2,0,5,2,3
4360,4361,i 've had it for about a month and love the look and overall design .,2,0,5,2,3
4361,4362,the weight is awesome as it 's very light yet the aluminum material gives a very classy feel but not as much as the does with the gold colored details .,2,0,5,2,3
4362,4363,"the technical specs are great but ssd speed could be better , both and most dell xps versions have better speed which is the only area this laptop fails to meet my expectations .",2,0,5,2,3
4363,4364,8th generation i7 is running really smooth with no delays so far .,2,0,5,2,3
4364,4365,the heat is not an issue as it does n't seem to heat up and i love the speakers as i do n't even need any exterior sound system around for a very good would be better if the same sound experience could be had in non-windows environments but i 'm guessing the drivers should be on the the ssd speed the,2,0,5,2,3
4365,4366,from my observation it seems to happen when the laptop is n't on a flat surface so some fan looks to be causing the this is a great choice for anyone that does n't care about the occasional scratchy noise and always on the go .,2,0,5,2,3
4366,4367,good connectivity and weight that stands  i prefer linux over windows but stuck with the pre-installed windows 10 .,2,0,5,2,3
4367,4368,after ubuntu 18 came out i installed it about 2 weeks ago ( may 2018 ) and have n't noticed the noise since .,2,0,5,2,3
4368,4369,the original issue might simply be driver related in windows but too early to tell .,2,0,5,2,3
4369,4370,i 'll be updating this information if i notice the noise again .,2,0,5,2,3
4370,4371,works great .,2,0,5,2,3
4371,4372,super fast .,2,0,5,2,3
4372,4373,"lightroom runs awesome , some games even work well on it .",2,0,5,2,3
4373,4374,i like the design .,2,0,5,2,3
4374,4375,it 's light .,2,0,5,2,3
4375,4376,and yes it 's a bit noisy at times but i 've gotten used to it .,2,0,5,2,3
4376,4377,this is a super fast 8th gen i7 15 '' laptop in a 14 '' form factor .,2,0,5,2,3
4377,4378,outstanding computer .,2,0,5,2,3
4378,4379,"lightweight , fast , and very capable .",2,0,5,2,3
4379,4380,"i use it mainly for general purpose school work and software development , and it handles everything i 've thrown at it easily .",2,0,5,2,3
4380,4381,plus its size and weight make it very portable .,2,0,5,2,3
4381,4382,"its not a in terms of display definition and components but then its less than half the price , 16gb ram & 8th gen i7 windows 10 , fast portable and light .",2,0,5,2,3
4382,4383,i 've read blogs about the fan and yes it comes on for a short time when hot but its not too annoying .,2,0,5,2,3
4383,4384,"i like this laptop a lot , no regrets and strongly recommend .",2,0,5,2,3
4384,4385,pros  slim and really technical battery  wo n't wake up from sleep .,2,0,5,2,3
4385,4386,i needed to reset the laptop several times !,2,0,5,2,3
4386,4387,it is really annoying ! !,2,0,5,2,3
4387,4388,! fingerprint sensor,2,0,5,2,3
4388,4389,"excellent computer for the price , absolutlely no fan noise as other reviewers have said , will update if any problem comes up",2,0,5,2,3
4389,4390,this laptop is incredibly portable and fast .,2,0,5,2,3
4390,4391,"as an student of systems engineering , i really need a laptop fast enough to do my job without trouble , not for gaming .",2,0,5,2,3
4391,4392,"the build quality is excellent , the battery is great but it could be better .",2,0,5,2,3
4392,4393,"i just receive my asus , everything is nice the laptop is very well crafted , slim and light .",2,0,5,2,3
4393,4394,i would give it 55 if it didnt lack one of the ( rubber feet ) on the back of the laptop .,2,0,5,2,3
4394,4395,"this kind of things should not happen on any new product , less on a 1000 $ product .",2,0,5,2,3
4395,4396,i expect you to send me some spare rubber feets at least .,2,0,5,2,3
4396,4397,amazing machine .,2,0,5,2,3
4397,4398,"super lightweight , solid , great spec .",2,0,5,2,3

4402,4403,i have had zero problems with mine so far .,2,0,5,2,3
4403,4404,the real battery life is about ten hours and it recharges quickly .,2,0,5,2,3
4404,4405,it is easy and quick to type on with good key feel and travel .,2,0,5,2,3
4405,4406,if i could change one thing it would be the screen flex .,2,0,5,2,3
4406,4407,"this version has a metal top but when i first opened it i could tell that the cover was so lightweight that it would bend very easily , which it does .",2,0,5,2,3
4407,4408,"on the other hand , i believe that this is the best laptop overall that you can buy at the low end of $ 1000 .",2,0,5,2,3
4408,4409,the 8th gen i7 is very fast and i expect to be happily using this laptop for several years .,2,0,5,2,3
4409,4410,"also , the slim bezels which allow for the 14-inch screen in this form factor are important .",2,0,5,2,3
4410,4411,do n't go out and get a 13-inch screen on another laptop .,2,0,5,2,3
4411,4412,that extra inch makes a difference .,2,0,5,2,3

4421,4422,excellent laptop very light and portable no complaints .,2,0,5,2,3

4428,4429,"a beautiful , powerful , and lightweight laptop .",2,0,5,2,3
4429,4430,"i have bought mine in usa and i am just started to use it in my home , brazil .",2,0,5,2,3
4430,4431,"by the moment it is working like expected , fast and quiet .",2,0,5,2,3
4431,4432,"but , does not have a regular hdmi port and unfortunately none adapter was included in the box , neither for the regular size nor to a vga port ( for a such expensive computer and based on my experience with asus - this is not my first asus laptop , it was really disappointing ) .",2,0,5,2,3
4432,4433,at home i like to use with a mouse and keyboard wireless and connected in a bigger screen ( vga connection in my case ) .,2,0,5,2,3
4433,4434,"just because of the lack of one or two , i give it the four stars , otherwise it would certainly five stars .",2,0,5,2,3
4434,4435,i purchased this because i wanted to upgrade the asus i purchased a few years ago mainly to get the quad core i7 8550 processor .,2,0,5,2,3
4435,4436,i 've had asus computers in the past and have never had a problem .,2,0,5,2,3
4436,4437,this one does not disappoint .,2,0,5,2,3
4437,4438,"it 's fast , with a boot time of 3.5 seconds .",2,0,5,2,3
4438,4439,"it 's light , with a weight of about 2.8 lbs .",2,0,5,2,3
4439,4440,"it 's attractive , with the space grey color .",2,0,5,2,3
4440,4441,"and the display is , quite simply , stunning .",2,0,5,2,3
4441,4442,some reviews have talked about the fan being noisy .,2,0,5,2,3
4442,4443,"yes , you can hear the fan but it is n't overly loud .",2,0,5,2,3
4443,4444,one would expect the fan to run to dissipate the heat in such a small space .,2,0,5,2,3
4444,4445,the only thing i wish this model had would be an nvidia graphics card but the intel 620 graphics works well.i 'm very happy that i purchased this machine .,2,0,5,2,3
4445,4446,annoying traits with this computer .,2,0,5,2,3
4446,4447,"rarely logs on to internet without being prompted , sometimes takes several tries .",2,0,5,2,3
4447,4448,"touchpad left clicks often do not work , take a lot of pressure , hard to find a good place to press to engage a non null click .",2,0,5,2,3
4448,4449,backlight on keyboard will often require several clicks of the f key to start working .,2,0,5,2,3
4449,4450,would have preferred a standard hdmi port .,2,0,5,2,3
4450,4451,tiny one on this computer is hard to use and seems like it is designed to wear out .,2,0,5,2,3
4451,4452,"is slim , but is not light .",2,0,5,2,3
4452,4453,i guess i expected it to be a little more friendly .,2,0,5,2,3
4453,4454,"it is fast , has good connectivity and i like the non glare screen and chiclet keys .",2,0,5,2,3
4454,4455,if the touchpad worked better i would have given it 4 stars,2,0,5,2,3
4455,4456,i got mine at costco about a week ago .,2,0,5,2,3
4456,4457,so far it is everything i was looking for .,2,0,5,2,3
4457,4458,i almost talked myself out of buying it because of all the gripes in the one star ratings here at amazon .,2,0,5,2,3
4458,4459,"so far i 've had none of the perpetual fan running , screeching innards or other cited failings that had nearly kept me from buying it .",2,0,5,2,3
4459,4460,"i have not attempted the fingerprint reader , having enough frustration with that on my android phone .",2,0,5,2,3
4460,4461,the only time i noticed the fan was when i was loading software .,2,0,5,2,3
4461,4462,"after that , the fan has been quiet or barely noticeable when it does will admit that i 'm not doing processor intensive work .",2,0,5,2,3
4462,4463,"i bought this mostly for a travel computer , and it appears to be ideal for that .",2,0,5,2,3
4463,4464,"it 's slim , lightweight and the battery appears to hold a long enough charge that i wo n't need to haul the charger in my carry on bag , so i 'm looking forward to a lighter load on future my intention was for travel , as i 'm getting used to using it , i 'm finding i use it far",2,0,5,2,3
4464,4465,some of that is no doubt because of the beautiful display as well as the pleasure of using the accurate mouse pad and keyboard .,2,0,5,2,3
4465,4466,"lightweight with a small footprint , quick enough for everyday tasks , good build quality for the price .",2,0,5,2,3
4466,4467,i purchased this laptop from another retailer for about 700 dollars in november of 2017 which is a great value for what this computer,2,0,5,2,3
4467,4468,deciding to wait for processor was a good decision .,2,0,5,2,3
4468,4469,it finally has 4 cores .,2,0,5,2,3
4469,4470,it really makes the difference .,2,0,5,2,3
4470,4471,now i have a device which is small and light but its performance is comparable to desktop machines .,2,0,5,2,3
4471,4472,if we use the full potential however the battery drains very fast and it can get hot - but this is something i was expecting .,2,0,5,2,3
4472,4473,device is perfect if you need high performance from time to time .,2,0,5,2,3
4473,4474,"if you just do web browsing , on battery is body looks and feels very solid .",2,0,5,2,3
4474,4475,screen is also very good.it has warranty which actually works in poland where i live .,2,0,5,2,3
4475,4476,it is not that common when buying laptops abroad !,2,0,5,2,3
4476,4477,great laptop .,2,0,5,2,3
4477,4478,great specs for its price .,2,0,5,2,3
4478,4479,good battery life with average of 7-8 hours .,2,0,5,2,3
4479,4480,high quality matte display with minimal bezels ( slightly more than the xps 13 but it is unnoticeable ) .,2,0,5,2,3
4480,4481,really like the setting that allows users to adjust brightness of the backlit keyboard .,2,0,5,2,3
4481,4482,this is an excellent laptop and might be the best laptop on the market right now .,2,0,5,2,3
4482,4483,it is extremely fast with a high-resolution display .,2,0,5,2,3
4483,4484,it is extremely light and is feasible for students because of its weight .,2,0,5,2,3
4484,4485,i got this as a gift about 6 months ago .,2,0,5,2,3
4485,4486,i read the reviews and got worried about noises coming from inside and to be honest i only heard that during the initial set up of the system .,2,0,5,2,3
4486,4487,"i am a computer science major , so i use it often for programming and do minor graphic designing with it .",2,0,5,2,3
4487,4488,this thing is a beast and does everything i want it to and quickly .,2,0,5,2,3
4488,4489,i ’ m very pleased with it and am glad to have it .,2,0,5,2,3
4489,4490,great laptop for an awesome price .,3,1,0,5,7
4490,4491,thanks for the quick shipment .,3,1,0,5,7
4491,4492,i went into this purchase a little nervous .,2,9,0,0,7
4492,4493,my other tabletlaptop hybrid experiences had been i can honestly say this is perfect for my needs .,2,9,0,0,7

4721,4723,thanks to my friends i started doing some research and did not want to go all in on a huge rig just because i was still apprehensive .,3,8,2,5,7

4730,4732,its a great machine but has a 1 hour battery life if playing a game some games stress the gpu out and the memory runs at max fairly often but other than those small issues its perfect for its price,3,8,2,5,7

4739,4741,i have had it a couple of months now and my games perform much better on it vs my old laptop .,3,8,2,5,7
4740,4742,a big reason i went with this over other comparable models was this one offered a lit keyboard in red .,3,8,2,5,7
4741,4743,i know some people do not like that it 's red but red does n't mess with your eyes as much at night so i was happy they made it that color .,3,8,2,5,7
4742,4744,its bright enough to see the keys but not obnoxious or overly stimulating .,3,8,2,5,7

4762,4764,it is fine in low light and when there is a white background ( which there typically is in most apps ) .,3,5,2,1,3
4763,4765,"i do use the laptop outside , so it is usable , there are just times when the reflection is too apparent , and interferes with seeing the looks very sleek and feels very solid .",3,5,2,1,3
4764,4766,"when i sit in certain positions with the laptop on my lap ( go figure ) , the edges cut into my hands or wrists uncomfortably .",3,5,2,1,3

4816,4818,"no , it 's not 4k but i have little need for that in a laptop .",3,5,2,1,3
4817,4819,"8gb of ram powers the hungry windows 10 just fine for everything i throw at it , which admittedly is n't incredibly demanding , but i also have a laptop that crawls along on 2gb ram in windows 10 making for a pretty miserable experience .",3,5,2,1,3

4822,4824,"microsoft really has n't been able to nail down a good tablet experience on a touchscreen pc just yet , but it is kind of handy when doing things such as drawing as i , at least , would rather touch the surface of the drawing rather than use a wacom tablet .",3,5,2,1,3
4823,4825,"but outside of that , it 's best in laptop mode or tent mode for video watching .",3,5,2,1,3

4827,4829,it starts up quickly because of the ssd .,3,5,2,1,3
4828,4830,battery life is good .,3,5,2,1,3
4829,4831,it 's a great laptop for general one negative is that the screen came with some air bubbles in it .,3,5,2,1,3
4830,4832,"it 's like a line of air bubbles near the bottom of the screen , and it 's actually a very noticeable flaw on an otherwise high quality screen .",3,5,2,1,3

4854,4856,"it has a sleek design and a crisp screen that makes videos look as if you are actually there in graphics of the computer , however , leave some room to be desired .",3,5,2,1,3
4855,4857,"this is not a laptop you will be playing games on as it barely scrapes by to make the requirements for civilization 5 , never-mind any newer are a few features that i have enjoyed in the last few weeks .",3,5,2,1,3
4856,4858,"first , the fingerprint sensor makes logging in fast and easy .",3,5,2,1,3
4857,4859,it is very reliable and almost always recognizes my fingerprint on the first try .,3,5,2,1,3
4858,4860,"second , the keyboard has a comfortable feel to it .",3,5,2,1,3
4859,4861,the keys are crisp enough to have satisfaction when you type while not so loud that the whole neighborhood can hear you crunch the keys ( as with some mechanical keyboards .,3,5,2,1,3
4860,4862,") the battery life is satisfactory , but not the best i have seen in a laptop .",3,5,2,1,3
4861,4863,"keep in mind that the screen in this computer is huge , and that alone can create a strain on the battery .",3,5,2,1,3
4862,4864,"those people who like to go long periods of time without charging may find themselves out of luck and stuck in the abysmal battery saver now on the flex part of the product , i don ’ t see myself using the tablet version too much .",3,5,2,1,3
4863,4865,"one way that feature is extremely useful , though , is for reading or watching a movie .",3,5,2,1,3
4864,4866,"instead of having a heavy laptop sprawled across you ( and the laptop is decently heavy ) , one can easily hold it in a more natural position to help facilitate hours of netflix binge , my experience with this laptop has been a positive one .",3,5,2,1,3
4865,4867,"this laptop deserves a hearty 4 out of 5 stars , and to those inquiring into its purchase i do recommend it for students , businesses , and non-gamers .",3,5,2,1,3
4866,4868,this computer is light and has a huge screen with decent graphics that is perfect for work or streaming movies .,3,5,2,1,3
4867,4869,"setup is extremely easy , you get guided by cortana 's voice through the process .",3,5,2,1,3
4868,4870,after you setup an account you will be free to use your new laptop however you want .,3,5,2,1,3
4869,4871,it has a an intel core i5 8th gen processor that delivers quick online searches and streaming .,3,5,2,1,3
4870,4872,"love my laptop , especially the extra large screen .",4,6,3,5,3
4871,4873,"fast processor , quick keyboard action .",4,6,3,5,3
4872,4874,"the screen looks a bit whitewashed , i wish the color was more saturated .",4,6,3,5,3
4873,4875,i turn the brightness up and it just get whiter .,4,6,3,5,3
4874,4876,turn it down and it gets blacker .,4,6,3,5,3
4875,4877,the sound works well but the speaker are on the bottom which is strange .,4,6,3,5,3
4876,4878,"i never cared for the mouse on a laptop , i use a mini wireless mouse and it works great .",4,6,3,5,3
4877,4879,"works great for games , watching tv , using microsoft office .",4,6,3,5,3
4878,4880,there is one gaming website i have n't been able to work with my computer .,4,6,3,5,3
4879,4881,not sure what the problem is .,4,6,3,5,3
4880,4882,"i did lots of research before buying and i think for all that is desired in this laptop , it is a great buy with all it offers in screen size , storage , and speed .",4,6,3,5,3
4881,4883,it also has a dvd player which i really wanted included .,4,6,3,5,3
4882,4884,"compared to similar computers at other stores , most of them without dvd players , they were more expensive and i think this was a great buy for the price and features offered .",4,6,3,5,3
4883,4885,if i had an unlimited budget it would n't be my first pick but that is not the case .,4,6,3,5,3
4884,4886,"great product , great price , fast shipping .",4,6,3,5,3
4885,4887,excellent laptop,4,6,3,5,3

4893,4895,"great laptop , setup was easy , easy to use .",4,6,3,5,3
4894,4896,so far battery lasts as promised,4,6,3,5,3
4895,4897,i got mine at a big box store for less than half what amazon is currently charging .,4,6,3,5,3
4896,4898,"for sup $ 250 laptop , i am impressed with its specs .",4,6,3,5,3
4897,4899,"but the slow hard drive made it impossible to work with ( my work uses dropbox , syncing will tie up the whole machine ) but - since i only use it for personal things now it is a great only two real downsides to this machine are  else is pretty good to be honest .",4,6,3,5,3
4898,4900,it even runs source engine games at .,4,6,3,5,3
4899,4901,"( gmod , counter strike , etc . )",4,6,3,5,3
4900,4902,"well built , fast and hp made .",4,6,3,5,3

4902,4904,thank you .,4,6,3,5,3
4903,4905,i am using it to write this review .,3,6,2,5,0
4904,4906,"well , i will not say it has the best specs if you compare to other gaming laptops .",3,6,2,5,0
4905,4907,i just want a graphics card to run little editing stuff and light gaming .,3,6,2,5,0
4906,4908,1050 2gb for heavy gaming ,3,6,2,5,0
4907,4909,you can dream about it ... ... speaker amazed me !,3,6,2,5,0
4908,4910,"it is almost the same as using headphone when i listen to my favorite music , but you have to be right in front at the , the performance is good ; the cpu is the lastest and keyboard is quite good and do n't really like the red line design but i rather it is plain battery can let",3,6,2,5,0
4909,4911,"it works well even though i am a little far away from the router and have a wall in fan is not noisy , and the thermal control is very good .",3,6,2,5,0
4910,4912,i feel slightly warm when i am using it to light do recommend you buy the ssd version though .,3,6,2,5,0
4911,4913,it is quite slow when i trying to install software even though it is an will add an ssd later .,3,6,2,5,0
4912,4914,this thin and light notebook computer was not purchased for gaming but for work .,3,6,2,5,0
4913,4915,"it has the correct components for how i use it , plus , it has an 8th generation intel cpu , has room for a ssd , and for up to 32gb of ram , unusual for an asus , but a pleasant surprise , from my past experience with asus , having made three previous purchases .",3,6,2,5,0
4914,4916,"in my business , i am constantly downloading large files ( 3-4 gb ) and then watching the digital footage , maybe editing it , and re-editing it .",3,6,2,5,0
4915,4917,"this notebook is perfect for how i use it , and it 's light and seems sturdy , though the case appears to be all plastic .",3,6,2,5,0
4916,4918,"it does n't have as many usb ports as i 'd like , but it has enough for the price point ( is n't that why they have usb hubs  )",3,6,2,5,0
4917,4919,"and , of course , no optical drive , but i have a nice blu-ray external drive that cost me about $ 20 , which is small , light , and handy to carry in the carry sleeve i bought to go with the notebook .",3,6,2,5,0
4918,4920,"it would nice if it had a docking station of some sort , but that was n't a deal breaker , just an afterthought .",3,6,2,5,0
4919,4921,"the most important lesson i learned is to read the warranty before you buy the product , because , this one is only 1 year ( which i knew ) , will not be extended by the manufacturer , which i did n't know , ( leaving you to wrestle with the decision whether or not to take your chances or go with a",3,6,2,5,0
4920,4922,"had i to do it all over , i would pick a manufacturer that only made repairs and replacements with new parts , if any exist out in the notebook world , or maybe they are all like that ( have n't had time to read the other warranties , yet , but will before my next purchase ) .",3,6,2,5,0
4921,4923,"analysis at this point is that was a smart purchase and everything functions as it should , though a ram upgrade is in the near future , as 8 gigs is tasked every time i use the machine , but adequate for now .",3,6,2,5,0
4922,4924,"i would buy another one , at this point , because of the price point , and pray it does n't need any repairs .",3,6,2,5,0
4923,4925,"however , for 3-4 hundred dollars more , maybe a better warranty and machine could be had ; that extra 3-4 hundred was not in my budget so i did n't really look .",3,6,2,5,0
4924,4926,i 'll be back if any important updates are in order .,3,6,2,5,0
4925,4927,update  asus asked me to return the laptop for keyboard repairs .,3,6,2,5,0
4926,4928,turns out there is no option to purchase onsite warranty or extended warranty here in the us .,3,6,2,5,0
4927,4929,the whole process could take 2-3 weeks .,3,6,2,5,0
4928,4930,so i returned the laptop back to amazon .,3,6,2,5,0
4929,4931,the return process was swift and easy .,3,6,2,5,0
4930,4932,"watch out for the limited one year warranty , there is no way to extend that .",3,6,2,5,0
4931,4933,i 'd suggest looking at the dell g3 and g5 which was just released which is way better at the same  very prompt delivery .,3,6,2,5,0
4932,4934,came in a amazon box .,3,6,2,5,0
4933,4935,the asus box inside had two puncture marks ( i 've attached the photos ) .,3,6,2,5,0
4934,4936,thankfully the deeper puncture mark missed the laptop and went through the cardboard skirting that holds the laptop in place inside its box .,3,6,2,5,0
4935,4937,the asus laptop box was also placed upside down .,3,6,2,5,0
4936,4938,if the whole package was kept on the floor the only thing between the ground and the laptop were two sheets of cardboard .,3,6,2,5,0
4937,4939,all the air filled cushioning material was on the wrong side .,3,6,2,5,0
4938,4940,it 's lucky that usps handled it carefully and nothing broke on the outside .,3,6,2,5,0
4939,4941,still a little worried about the effect that might have had on the the laptop  this was just launched like 3 weeks before it was ordered .,3,6,2,5,0
4940,4942,so i was skeptical about the initial hiccups new range of laptops come .,3,6,2,5,0

4945,4947,the processor is pretty good .,3,6,2,5,0
4946,4948,almost on par with and in some ways better than the for anyone confused between the .,3,6,2,5,0
4947,4949,the graphics card is not that great but for the price of $ 699 it is sufficiently .,3,6,2,5,0
4948,4950,the cooling fans are very very effective but insanely noisy .,3,6,2,5,0
4949,4951,played battlefield 3 on ultra settings and after a while the middle section of the keyboard was pretty warmhot but the wasd area was almost at room temperature .,3,6,2,5,0
4950,4952,you could feel the negative air pressure pulling air into the fan through the keys in that general area ( no idea if this is a good thing or bad ) 5 .,3,6,2,5,0
4951,4953,the trackpad has a nice feel to it but a slightly noisy .,3,6,2,5,0

4958,4960,it makes tiny clunking .,3,6,2,5,0
4959,4961,battery life is really bad .,3,6,2,5,0
4960,4962,2-3 hours is the most you can get out of this even on battery .,3,6,2,5,0
4961,4963,the fans are really noisy ! stuff that might just be wrong with the device i received and not necessarily the product .,3,6,2,5,0
4962,4964,the backlight flickers when it is kept at the lowest brightness level .,3,6,2,5,0
4963,4965,i 've attached a video of it too .,3,6,2,5,0
4964,4966,the flickering you see is not due to the camera but the backlights on the .,3,6,2,5,0
4965,4967,a portion of the f9 key is not lit up .,3,6,2,5,0
4966,4968,a part of the leds beneath the key are not lighting up.i guess i 'll have to contact asus regarding this .,3,6,2,5,0
4967,4969,really not pleased about it is a pretty good laptop for the cost .,3,6,2,5,0
4968,4970,another one in this range that might be as durable as this one is dell 15 5000 gaming .,3,6,2,5,0
4969,4971,this one just looks way too cooler and was made for 'll add new stuff as i discover it about this laptop .,3,6,2,5,0

4972,4974,most games will run superb on settings .,3,6,2,5,0
4973,4975,overall i 'm very satisfied with this purchase .,3,6,2,5,0
4974,4976,"i bought this as a gift for relative , he loves it , uses it everyday for work and at home .",3,6,2,5,0
4975,4977,it is mostly plastic except for the lid cover but doesn ’ t look or feel cheap .,3,6,2,5,0
4976,4978,"the 8th gen cpu is really good as expected , the 1050 also allows to play most games at fhd set in mid quality but the display isn ’ t as bright as you ’ d like .",3,6,2,5,0
4977,4979,"my only complain would be the lack of an ssd that would definitely improve things but again , it ’ s understandable for the price .",3,6,2,5,0
4978,4980,the good thing is you actually got an empty ssd drive slot available in case you want to upgrade .,3,6,2,5,0

4984,4986,"well the computer is fast and is decent for its price , the video quality is very disappointing .",3,6,2,5,0

5050,5052,"my old hp died and i knew i ’ d have an impossible time replacing the nice keyboard and design of the lap top itself , which was comfy , fluid , etc .",4,6,4,5,3
5051,5053,this is a very good purchase for me .,4,6,4,5,3
5052,5054,i have too many other expenses to spend more .,4,6,4,5,3

5057,5059,so far ... so good !,3,4,2,5,3
5058,5060,i just wish i had gotten a smaller screen .,3,4,2,5,3
5059,5061,"apparently , the larger screens come with a keyboard with the numeric keypad which i really did not want .",3,4,2,5,3
5060,5062,"i 'm always putting my hands on the keyboard in the wrong spot because of the numeric keypad , but that 's my problem .",3,4,2,5,3

5071,5073,"if you 're a power user , this will probably not be for you .",3,4,2,5,3
5072,5074,"but it 's good for office , web browsing , powerpoint presentations , etc .",3,4,2,5,3
5073,5075,i wish it had a solid state hard drive option .,3,4,2,5,3
5074,5076,that would have pushed it to 5-star territory .,3,4,2,5,3

5082,5084,love the touch screen it 's so cool,3,4,2,5,3
5083,5085,"for a stripped down software computer with lots of power , this is the best bang for your buck !",3,4,2,5,3

5093,5095,i followed the popular recommendations to purchase the 128gb ssd along with the 1tb hard drive .,3,7,2,5,7
5094,5096,"very fast , nice screen , like the fingerprint sensor .",3,7,2,5,7
5095,5097,here are the shortcomings that keep it from a 5.1 ) power key is located within the keyboard up at the top right corner .,3,7,2,5,7
5096,5098,"it is adjacent to the often used delete , backspace , and home keys .",3,7,2,5,7
5097,5099,really ,3,7,2,5,7
5098,5100,this passed their use case criteria ,3,7,2,5,7
5099,5101,i often miss the delete or backspace keys and am accidentally putting my laptop into sleep .,3,7,2,5,7

5102,5104,deep .,3,7,2,5,7

5104,5106,found the workaround at a cnet article .,3,7,2,5,7
5105,5107,"since amazon wo n't allow url 's in reviews , just google `` asus power button '' and it will be the first ) keyboard is not backlit .",3,7,2,5,7
5106,5108,this should be a simple feature addition that is minor in terms of cost .,3,7,2,5,7
5107,5109,merely an led and a light tube .,3,7,2,5,7
5108,5110,would have been worth a few extra buck were this to be included in their bill of ) no ethernet port .,3,7,2,5,7
5109,5111,sometimes it 's necessary to be hardwired into a router to configure things .,3,7,2,5,7
5110,5112,this computer is fantastic .,3,7,2,5,7
5111,5113,"i did a lot of researching looking for laptops in varying sizes ( 13.3 , 15.6 , 17.3 ) .",3,7,2,5,7
5112,5114,"i was looking for an ssd and i5 8th gen cpu , and at a great price .",3,7,2,5,7
5113,5115,after arrival this computer easily beat my expectations .,3,7,2,5,7
5114,5116,the computer is super fast ( thanks ssd ) and has no problem running large excel spreadsheets and access files .,3,7,2,5,7
5115,5117,i looked at more expensive laptops and almost pulled the trigger on the $ 750 zenbook .,3,7,2,5,7
5116,5118,i 'm more than happy with this `` cheaper '' alternative that all of my needs .,3,7,2,5,7
5117,5119,"ssd , 8th gen i5",3,7,2,5,7
5118,5120,laptop is super light and slim too which makes it ultra portable,3,7,2,5,7
5119,5121,this computer is great .,3,7,2,5,7
5120,5122,"i am very satisfied with it and i would definitely recommend it , especially for the price ! the good  it is so fast .",3,7,2,5,7

5125,5127,"the battery life is awesome , way better than my last laptop .",3,7,2,5,7
5126,5128,this laptop is very lightweight and bad things ; one month after having it the videos stopped playing and i was getting error messages .,3,7,2,5,7
5127,5129,"long story short , i needed to update my sound drivers and now it is working fine .",3,7,2,5,7
5128,5130,"the other thing is left clicking on the mouse pad is n't the best , but it works .",3,7,2,5,7
5129,5131,this is easily solvable by getting a wireless mouse .,3,7,2,5,7
5130,5132,"all in all , i would definitely recommend this laptop , especially over the others that i have had and used .",3,7,2,5,7
5131,5133,i 've had the for a week .,3,7,2,5,7
5132,5134,i love this machine .,3,7,2,5,7
5133,5135,i have hhr combined ssd and 1 tb hd .,3,7,2,5,7
5134,5136,i did my research on the specs and this is the best value i could find for the machine booted up windows 10 in exactly 10 seconds !,3,7,2,5,7
5135,5137,after i set up my fingerprint scan it does the fast and easy boot up every time .,3,7,2,5,7
5136,5138,i am surprised by how fat it far it 's completely silent .,3,7,2,5,7
5137,5139,"no fan noise no hdd boot up noise , would suggest that you see the youtube reviews of the machine , the keyboard is a bit plain and the build is plastic , but for me it is just fine.i love that i can upgrade it and both the memory and the ssd and this will be by far the best machine i",3,7,2,5,7
5138,5140,"i am happy with this purchase , and i think you will too .",3,7,2,5,7
5139,5141,wife and i were looking for a solid at home laptop that can be used for work if necessary .,3,7,2,5,7
5140,5142,saw this was amazon 's choice and popular laptop .,3,7,2,5,7
5141,5143,"after reading the reviews and recommendations , bought crucial 8gb single 2400 ( ) dr x8 unbuffered sodimm memory - .",3,7,2,5,7
5142,5144,"this is a quick laptop and thankful for all the helpful the computer was set up , make sure the change over where new files were being saved .",3,7,2,5,7
5143,5145,"outside of that , fantastic laptop and would recommend to others",3,7,2,5,7
5144,5146,"love every aspect of this , except there is no backlighting for the keys .",3,7,2,5,7
5145,5147,did n't even think to check as every laptop i have had came standard with it .,3,7,2,5,7
5146,5148,"with that said , it is light weight , fast , nice display , chicklet keys .",3,7,2,5,7
5147,5149,do n't miss not having a number pad since all of the models with the pad have the touch pad off center .,3,7,2,5,7
5148,5150,over all very pleased with this laptop .,3,7,2,5,7
5149,5151,definitely 5 star but dropped to 4 due to the lack of backlighting,3,7,2,5,7
5150,5152,"so i just got this laptop this month , so it 's still early on , but so far i love it .",3,7,2,5,7
5151,5153,"i needed a new computer because the screen on my old one was on the fritz , making me not exactly want to use it .",3,7,2,5,7
5152,5154,it 's amazing having a fully functioning laptop again .,3,7,2,5,7
5153,5155,"the setup on this is easy to do , they even walk you right through it .",3,7,2,5,7
5154,5156,it 's really quick ( especially compared to my old one ) and i 'm loving the fingerprint scanner .,3,7,2,5,7
5155,5157,"i realized a few days into using it that it does n't have a number pad like my old one , but i 'm accommodating to get around it was mostly the minus key i 'm missing so i can quickly add things like em dashes while i 'm typing in word .",3,7,2,5,7
5156,5158,so far so good .,3,7,2,5,7
5157,5159,i 'm so happy i went with this laptop versus any others i had been looking at .,3,7,2,5,7
5158,5160,"i may be developing a brand loyalty here ; my old laptop was asus , too , and it lasted me quite some time .",3,7,2,5,7
5159,5161,i 'm very satisfied with this laptop .,3,7,2,5,7
5160,5162,"being so thin and so light , yet is has a build quality that i think rivals others in the price range .",3,7,2,5,7
5161,5163,"an 8th generation intel i5 , 8gb of ram , and a 1080p display that 's vivid and crisp , paired with speakers that are n't that bad and chiclet keyboard that 's responsive  yeah , i 'd say it 's a pretty good piece of tech for the life is pretty decent .",3,7,2,5,7
5162,5164,"it 's listed at 8 hours , but of course depending on how you use it that will vary .",3,7,2,5,7
5163,5165,"having usb is a nice touch , as well as usb 3.0 ports .",3,7,2,5,7
5164,5166,"of course for me , the 8gb of ram it comes with is enough , but it 's a little `` future proofed '' with the ability to add more , which is always a plus .",3,7,2,5,7
5165,5167,"my only gripe is that it does n't have a dedicated graphics card , but it can still handle some less demanding games.i 'd definitely recommend this to anyone trying to upgrade from an older laptop , or just someone who wants a good all around laptop in general",3,7,2,5,7
5166,5168,i 've owned this laptop for a week .,3,7,2,5,7
5167,5169,the laptop is as advertised .,3,7,2,5,7
5168,5170,"the screen display is great , the laptop is very thin and light , easily fits into my bookbag at 15.6 '' .",3,7,2,5,7
5169,5171,it came with 128 gb ssd and a 1 tb hdd drive .,3,7,2,5,7
5170,5172,"the intel core is awesome ; although , i think i would be a little more comfortable with 16 gb of ram and a little more solid state storage ( ) to make it run just a tad faster , but i ca n't complain at all for the cost .",3,7,2,5,7
5171,5173,"i have n't done anything too strenuous , but i like to have a little extra room for hardcore multitasking andor gaming since i 'll be starting graduate school in a few days .",3,7,2,5,7
5172,5174,windows 10 feels fresh with their updates .,3,7,2,5,7
5173,5175,"heck , i might even use edge .",3,7,2,5,7
5174,5176,just kidding .,3,7,2,5,7
5175,5177,i love is the fingerprint scanner .,3,7,2,5,7
5176,5178,"this is my first laptop with a fingerprint scanner , and on this asus it 's very fast so that is convenient .",3,7,2,5,7
5177,5179,"the laptop has been very quiet , and has n't heated up on me yet .",3,7,2,5,7
5178,5180,"it feels very nice holding it in my lap because there is plenty of space for the palms of your hands to rest while you type if you 're leaning back.the keyboard is n't amazing , and i have n't used the webcam yet .",3,7,2,5,7
5179,5181,"at first , the touchpad was very irritating as it kept flipping on and off , but a quick download of the driver fixed that .",3,7,2,5,7
5180,5182,"the whole touchpad never turns off anymore , but very occasionally i lose capacity to scroll with two fingers , in which cases i have to click the scroll bar to scroll .",3,7,2,5,7
5181,5183,"the speakers on this laptop are n't loud at all at max volume , but that is n't that high of a priority to me , in a few days when i 'll be on campus .",3,7,2,5,7
5182,5184,with any windows computer i have to delete some unnecessary things before i use though .,3,7,2,5,7
5183,5185,"this one was n't any different but it did n't take in all , my budget was $ 800 , but i was sold on this $ 600 computer .",3,7,2,5,7
5184,5186,"to me , with the 8th gen processor and only 3.7 lbs , this was an easy choice if you value portability and performance on a budget .",3,7,2,5,7
5185,5187,"if you do n't care about the portability , the acer aspire e 15 gives this laptop a very good run for its money at the same price .",3,7,2,5,7
5186,5188,but at over 5 lbs i had to turn my head .,3,7,2,5,7
5187,5189,"good performance , portability , display and pros  quiet fan even under display works well , has good viewing angles , and remains fairly color-accurate , if not exceptionally  keyboard is not great ( rattles , bounces , feels cheap ) webcam is like all-plastic construction , though i was under the impression it was flimsy chassis",3,7,2,5,7
5188,5190,this is a great laptop that boots and is logged on in under eight seconds ( if you use the fingerprint scanner ) and launches apps lightning-fast .,3,7,2,5,7
5189,5191,battery life is four hours .,3,7,2,5,7
5190,5192,"cons are that the keyboard is not back-lit , there is little key travel , there is no physical indication that caps lock is on and there is no number pad .",3,7,2,5,7
5191,5193,"if you do n't mind those things , put some serious thought into buying this laptop .",3,7,2,5,7
5192,5194,"i just got my new laptop in the mail last night , and i am very happy with it so far .",3,7,2,5,7
5193,5195,"i read the reviews before i bought it , and i think a lot of the reviewers bought the version of this computer with just the regular hard drive .",3,7,2,5,7
5194,5196,i sprung the extra ~ $ 90 for the 128 gb sold state hard drive .,3,7,2,5,7
5195,5197,"when i plugged in and started the new computer up , i found it was very fast .",3,7,2,5,7
5196,5198,"so far everything is working very well , and i am happy with it .",3,7,2,5,7
5197,5199,"for this budget price , i think this is really an excellent buy !",3,7,2,5,7
5198,5200,pros  lightweight and looks nice .,3,7,2,5,7
5199,5201, no `` caps lock-on '' indicator .,3,7,2,5,7
5200,5202,no backlighting on the keyboard .,3,7,2,5,7
5201,5203,i bought it because the sdd was supposed to make it blindingly fast but it crawls .,3,7,2,5,7
5202,5204,( i had to check that the caps lock was off after typing that last word . ),3,7,2,5,7
5203,5205,my 10 year old toshiba laptop runs rings around the asus .,3,7,2,5,7
5204,5206,"since it came with no user manual , i had to call asus customer support and got someone who knew all about windows 10 software but nothing about my asus notebook .",3,7,2,5,7
5205,5207,"for the backlighting , he sent me some zip files for atk and chipset which i do n't know how to use and which i should n't have to use .",3,7,2,5,7
5206,5208,i hope someone from asus is reading this because otherwise this needs to go back !,3,7,2,5,7
5207,5209,absolutely love this laptop .,3,7,2,5,7
5208,5210,"fast boot , runs for hours on battery .",3,7,2,5,7
5209,5211,"use for cctv management , sage accounting software .",3,7,2,5,7
5210,5212,no backlit keys but keyboard is sturdy built .,3,7,2,5,7
5211,5213,uses ssd for os and apps and hdd for data .,3,7,2,5,7
5212,5214,highly recommend .,3,7,2,5,7
5213,5215,this unit does not come with an ethernet port .,3,7,2,5,7
5214,5216,good laptop .,3,7,2,5,7
5215,5217,it opens quickly .,3,7,2,5,7
5216,5218,amazon packaging was not good .,3,7,2,5,7
5217,5219,laptop was n't stable inside the box hopefully working great .,3,7,2,5,7
5218,5220,do n't use option it wastes % 25 of your cpu power .,3,7,2,5,7
5219,5221,if you open it just close it .,3,7,2,5,7
5220,5222,"other than backlit keyboard , every other specs are very satisfactory with this screen is very crisp and cpu speed is very fast .",3,7,2,5,7
5221,5223,"furthermore , the thickness of pc is also very ergonomic for typing .",3,7,2,5,7
5222,5224,i am using 3 asus laptop .,3,7,2,5,7
5223,5225,"overall , asus laptop give excellent",3,7,2,5,7
5224,5226,"nice , lightweight laptop .",3,7,2,5,7
5225,5227,this new laptop was packed well and is in great condition .,3,7,2,5,7
5226,5228,no scratches or anything sticking out of the laptop as some other reviews have mentioned .,3,7,2,5,7
5227,5229,initial setup was super easy .,3,7,2,5,7
5228,5230,"i will use this for internet surfing , watching videos , creating and updating documents via microsoft office and maybe some games .",3,7,2,5,7
5229,5231,i will update this review as i start to use it or if i encounter any issues or errors .,3,7,2,5,7
5230,5232,definitely an improvement from my last computer it is pretty fast and has not that much bloatware .,3,7,2,5,7
5231,5233,it works well but the keyboard is my biggest issue .,3,7,2,5,7
5232,5234,there are a couple of keys that you have to push two or more times to get them to type correctly .,3,7,2,5,7
5233,5235,"you never knew how many times you needed the `` l '' key until you type a whole sentence without thin and lightweight fhd laptop , 8th gen intel core , 8gb ram , 128gb hdd , usb , asus display , fingerprint reader , windows 10",3,7,2,5,7
5234,5236,good buy !,3,7,2,5,7
5235,5237,it would be nice if this model had the backlit keyboard .,3,7,2,5,7
5236,5238,"without the ssd , maybe it 's not so good ( when i access the hhd too much it 's kind of slowish , plus it gets a little warm where the right hand sits ) .",3,7,2,5,7
5237,5239,"it 's vere  sound is too low ( really , tooo low ) .",3,7,2,5,7
5238,5240,"screen is good , but in a very bright ambient is not bright enough",3,7,2,5,7
5239,5241,what i like about it is that having a solid state drive means that starts quickly and having 8gb ram means that it operates fast even when numerous programs are running and when memory hungry programs are running .,3,7,2,5,7
5240,5242,what is a minor issue is that the fairly heavy power supply plugs directly into the power point meaning that the extra weight can cause the power supply to come loose easily .,3,7,2,5,7
5241,5243,it would be better to have a short cord between the plug and the power supply so that this looseness does n't happen .,3,7,2,5,7
5242,5244,"pros  - because the operating system runs on an ssd , this pc boots up in 5 seconds which is extremely fast !",3,7,2,5,7
5243,5245,- very good looking .,3,7,2,5,7
5244,5246,- super light - excellent screen quality .,3,7,2,5,7
5245,5247,- good sound .,3,7,2,5,7
5246,5248,- good battery life ( 8 hours ) cons  - come with no num keyword .,3,7,2,5,7
5247,5249,- not a touchscreen pc .,3,7,2,5,7
5248,5250,- keyboard and mouse pad feels a bit like a toy .,3,7,2,5,7
5249,5251,- does not include ms office .,3,7,2,5,7
5250,5252,"i kind of feel bad about the fact that it does not have a graphics card or a backlit keyboard , but for this price , this thing is a treat ! absolutely no performance issue and screen is amazing , though i am starting to get a hint that this screen might not be exactly a full hd screen even though the system",3,7,2,5,7
5251,5253,"i 'd say the best affordable laptop out there  powerful , fast , sleek looking and perfect in every aspect .",3,7,2,5,7
5252,5254,"bought the one with an ssd included , this laptop is awesome for work , could n't be more happy .",3,7,2,5,7
5253,5255,"initial impression  pros  - sharp , fhd screen , - fast 128 ssd hard drive , plus a 1tb rpm light and ( no big deals to me though )  - no caps lock keyboard does n't feel poor webcam quality",3,7,2,5,7
5254,5256,excellent value .,3,7,2,5,7
5255,5257,for the money this is one of the best deals out there .,3,7,2,5,7
5256,5258,"great speed , lightweight , good battery life , and screen is crisp and bright .",3,7,2,5,7
5257,5259,glad i did n't drop three times the money for something that i would n't notice a ton of difference in .,3,7,2,5,7
5258,5260,i absolutely love this one !,3,7,2,5,7
5259,5261,"the screen was most important to me , and it 's simply the sharpest i could find in this price-range ( it 's ips ) 's quite light and compact , for a 15 '' other before me , i 'm glad i included the ssd option , and strongly recommend it 's not supposed to be a gaming computer ,",3,7,2,5,7
5260,5262,"overall grade  c ( for me , read consideration ) great for  travel , light duty work , lightweight , headphone  light light light ( like a spiral notebook light ) compact charger battery is all day amazing screen is bezels allow for a compact upgrade ssd lightning fast start drive upgrade  plastic",3,7,2,5,7
5261,5263,"but my main concerns for everyone is the heat and fan noises , both are very apparent and if you have this on your lap you better have a laptop tray or keep it on a desk .",3,7,2,5,7
5262,5264,"even when i was watching youtube or streaming netflix this thing kicked up immediately , even with low settings and the battery saver mode on .",3,7,2,5,7
5263,5265,the performance for the build seems lacking and struggled with 3 explorer windows open and one excel file while i was doing research and nothing in the background .,3,7,2,5,7
5264,5266,"which you should be able to run with an i-5 , i could accept this if it was an m3 or bottom of the bucket system but not with  if you are of average frame and strength then this build will be perfect and the keyboard flex and body is the perfect fit between lightweight and rigidity .",3,7,2,5,7
5265,5267,"my friends , both female and male , are going to by this set up for their travel needs but for me it is lacking .",3,7,2,5,7
5266,5268,please take in consideration that i stand at 6 ' x 255 and have a combined total of 1600 + on the big three lifts in power lifting so i am large and strong .,3,7,2,5,7
5267,5269,this adds to my need for a strong system and willing to sacrifice some weight for strength .,3,7,2,5,7
5268,5270,"also i do a lot of research as well as build systems so this may be my over expectations kicking in just a tad , if you are coming from only using low end systems this is probably a half grade up ( or b ) for  if you are looking for a travel laptop and are planning on doing light",3,7,2,5,7
5269,5271,not only is it light the battery charger is tiny and with the thin bezels this is a super compact design .,3,7,2,5,7
5270,5272,even with the fan and heat if you use a cool mat on your lap you will be find especially with the screen being amazing for the price .,3,7,2,5,7
5271,5273,and with all the ports available it is hard to go the price it is an amazing starting point and hard to beat especially with such an amazing brand such as asus .,3,7,2,5,7
5272,5274,always loved asus and they build amazing machines .,3,7,2,5,7
5273,5275,oh and this is a beautiful machine and the lid is amazing .,3,7,2,5,7

5288,5290,this will get work done in a blink of an eye .,3,7,2,5,7
5289,5291,the only downside is that it is not made of the highest quality material .,3,7,2,5,7
5290,5292,"the keyboard and touchpad feel a bit cheap , however it 's understandable with the price .",3,7,2,5,7

5335,5337,"do n't even bother calling customer support , in my experience , they do you no good .",3,7,2,5,7

5337,5339,fantastic computer .,3,7,2,5,7
5338,5340,very fast .,3,7,2,5,7
5339,5341,spend a little more money and get something that is much faster and reliable .,3,7,2,5,7
5340,5342,this one has the ssd already installed so you do not have to spend the $ 270 to add the ssd the other reviewers talk about on this same computer ( wo the ssd card ) .,3,7,2,5,7
5341,5343,"the first notebook replacement i purchased was the lenovo ideapad 320 , wow what a disappointment .",3,7,2,5,7

5345,5347,"my previous asus laptop i bought in 2009 ( ) is still working perfectly ( with the replacement of an ssd and a new battery , something like a knee surgery for human beings ... ) , not fast enough to work on a newer version of microsoft office .",3,7,2,5,7
5346,5348,so i bought this new asus for me and my far so good .,3,7,2,5,7
5347,5349,the fingerprint reader might be too sensitive ( reading my finger about 40 % of the time ) .,3,7,2,5,7
5348,5350,"in addition , the acoustic does not perform better than .",3,7,2,5,7

5358,5360,the charger is long and has a nice power light along with the slick look of the keyboard and red backlights which actually looks great so if your contemplating this vs an asus or the hp omen like i was i 'd def go for this one again .,3,7,2,1,0
5359,5361,oh and the fans are pretty quiet and effective along with easy to clean since you have one screw on the bottom of this and run a plastic pry tool around the edge and your into all the hardware .,3,7,2,1,0
5360,5362,also it boots in about 5 secs and i have a lot of programs booting on startup just to see how it would handle it .,3,7,2,1,0

5383,5385,"this along with the solid-state hard drive makes it 100 % silent which is really awesome ! while the charger is legitimately bulky ( as many other reviews say ) , its not nearly enough of a set-back to prevent me from giving it 5 stars !",3,7,2,1,0

5429,5431,not good for fast pace gaming .,3,7,2,1,0
5430,5432,"for example , trying to push w to move forward and nothing happens ...",3,7,2,1,0
5431,5433,"in 2007 i bought a new dell inspiron laptop , and in the ten years that followed i used the heck out of it .",3,7,2,1,0
5432,5434,"i edited thousands of documents , wrote software on it , even edited audio and video files , all running on a socket 775 core2 duo processor .",3,7,2,1,0
5433,5435,"that laptop is still running today , although it ca n't compete with the processors and underlying architecture of new systems ; they 're just so much faster and more capable forward to two weeks ago .",3,7,2,1,0
5434,5436,"i purchased this new `` gaming '' laptop , expecting a system that would meet my needs for today and years into the future .",3,7,2,1,0
5435,5437,so far my experience with this `` state of the art '' laptop has been anything but great .,3,7,2,1,0
5436,5438,"sure , it 's nice to look at with the dull , almost rubbery outer coating , the sleek red lines and illuminated , full-size keyboard .",3,7,2,1,0
5437,5439,"the laptop is , on paper , a very capable system , and i so wish it would have been what i hoped , but alas it falls fall very two biggest complaints about this system by far are the display , and the unit 's tendency to lcd display on this is atrocious .",3,7,2,1,0
5438,5440,you have such a narrow vertical viewing angle that you simply ca n't view the whole screen at its optimal contrast at the same time .,3,7,2,1,0
5439,5441,"when you tilt the display to put the `` sweet spot '' across the middle , the upper and lower sections of the display show that telltale reflection common on older , and lower end lcd panels , that makes images look washed out , almost shiny or inverted .",3,7,2,1,0
5440,5442,"and even the portion of the screen that 's optima has the dullest , most uninspiring color and contrast i 've seen since lcd 's first hit the market in the early 2000s .",3,7,2,1,0
5441,5443,"imagine one of those old projection televisions in a bar , with 4-5 years of smoke and dust film on the lenses , and you have an idea how washed out and unimpressive is this display .",3,7,2,1,0
5442,5444,the problem is the choice of technology  dell chose an lcd panel that uses twisted numatic ( tn ) technology to render the pixels .,3,7,2,1,0
5443,5445,"it ca n't hold a candle to the newer switching ( ips ) displays , which apple uses almost exclusively due to their superior color and contrast , or the latest organic led ( oled ) panels , which represent the very best in color and contrast .",3,7,2,1,0
5444,5446,"no , this panel is something you 'd expect to see on a $ 49 no-name tablet , or an early atm machine .",3,7,2,1,0
5445,5447,"i ca n't stop shaking my head over this , because ips panels are n't but a few dollars more than tn panels , and it would have a huge difference in the overall look and usability of this bad as the lcd is , the other issue is much worse , by far .",3,7,2,1,0
5446,5448,that is the laptop 's tendency to hang or hesitate .,3,7,2,1,0
5447,5449,"i noticed this right out of the box , and even after wiping the drive and installing a pristine ( i.e .",3,7,2,1,0
5448,5450,") windows 10 image , the system seems to hesitate , every few minutes , for anywhere from 5-15 seconds .",3,7,2,1,0
5449,5451,"the cursor pops up the `` busy '' spinning circle , and nothing responds to mouse clicks until seconds later .",3,7,2,1,0
5450,5452,"i 've updated the drivers to the very latest version , shut down unneeded services , even flashed the uefi bios to the latest version , but this hesitation continues , and it 's bad enough that it 's become a dealbreaker for me .",3,7,2,1,0
5451,5453,"i 've read stories from other people who 've had the same issue with this , so my gut tells me it 's probably a behavior i 'll have to learn to live with , and i 'm just not willing to spend $ on something that ca n't do any better than , amazon , but i got ta send this",3,7,2,1,0
5452,5454,"when it comes to technology i 'm not someone who has to have the most expensive , top of the line , best of the best of every component to be happy .",3,7,2,1,0
5453,5455,i understand that compromises have to be made to bring a price down to a more palatable point .,3,7,2,1,0
5454,5456,what makes me happy is a reliable machine that efficiently runs what i needwant it to without major issues or headaches at a decent price .,3,7,2,1,0
5455,5457,i am very happy with this laptop .,3,7,2,1,0
5456,5458,"it was what i expected it to be , a powerful and fast machine for the price .",3,7,2,1,0
5457,5459,"for the price of 800 dollars this laptop is pretty good and easily fyi the only things that can be upgradable is the ram , ssd , and if you want to you can install a hardrive .",3,7,2,1,0
5458,5460,"well , if you plan on watching youtube or the internet in general , then also plan on it freezing for about 15 seconds .",3,7,2,1,0
5459,5461,"then it will start beeping , blackscreen and go to sleep randomly .",3,7,2,1,0
5460,5462,this has to be a manufacturing error because it 's pretty ridiculous how often it happens .,3,7,2,1,0

5481,5483,this is a really classy-looking computer with a lot of cool features .,3,7,2,1,0
5482,5484,"on the other hand , it does have some disappointing short-comings , as you first start up the machine , you 'll see a bunch of legal gobbledygook on the screen .",3,7,2,1,0
5483,5485,"this user agreement , etc. , is very tedious reading on-screen , rather than on paper .",3,7,2,1,0
5484,5486,"it 's basically saying dell , microsoft and their affiliates can do pretty much whatever they want , while the user is quite limited in hisher rights .",3,7,2,1,0

5488,5490,you can adjust the back-lighting of the keyboard and the screen to adapt to personal preference during daylight use or in a darkened room .,3,7,2,1,0
5489,5491,"the mouse pad works fine , but i prefer to use a wireless mouse for more control .",3,7,2,1,0
5490,5492,"this one was particularly sensitive to touch , which i found annoying .",3,7,2,1,0

5492,5494,"either way , you can adjust the settings to suit your the screen on this computer is a few inches wider than my old laptop , the thickness of the computer is less .",3,7,2,1,0
5493,5495,this means it fits more easily into a protective sleeve or case .,3,7,2,1,0
5494,5496,the unit was surprisingly heavy -- most likely due to the battery and other hardware .,3,7,2,1,0
5495,5497,the power supply is about the size of a 3 x 5 inch card and considerably thinner than others i have seen .,3,7,2,1,0

5497,5499,it has a blue ring that lights up near the port when the unit is plugged in and charging .,3,7,2,1,0
5498,5500,"the battery seems to hold its charge for a long time , depending on what you do with the computer .",3,7,2,1,0

5516,5518,i was able to transfer some using a cable and flash drive or network sharing .,3,7,2,1,0
5517,5519,"nevertheless , i think this was a serious oversight in the design of a gaming computer .",3,7,2,1,0
5518,5520,"depending on what kind of system you have , i am not sure there are enough of the right kind of ports to connect this computer to ancillary devices .",3,7,2,1,0

5520,5522,"i am inclined , however , to keep the lens covered with a sticky note when not in use .",3,7,2,1,0
5521,5523,"call me paranoid , but the idea of someone being able to access and turn this on remotely to spy on me really creeps me out !",3,7,2,1,0

5524,5526,most of the other machines i am used to take their own sweet time -- which means you have to allow yourself a few minutes before sitting down to workplay when you start up the machine or before you walk away when you are done .,3,7,2,1,0
5525,5527,pros  - excellent expandability for memory and gtx 1050  - no now to the near fatal flaw .,3,7,2,1,0
5526,5528,the tn screen is nothing short of terrible .,3,7,2,1,0
5527,5529,"fortunately , replacing it is a straightforward procedure .",3,7,2,1,0
5528,5530,i ended up replacing mine with this  https   &,3,7,2,1,0
5529,5531,"i am not a serious gamer or a techie , but just a guy who uses computers for a variety of reasons , just like everyone else .",3,7,2,1,0
5530,5532,"so you should know that this review is based on the dell machine itself , and not on windows 10 .",3,7,2,1,0
5531,5533,"i chose a windows 10 machine because its the operating system that i am most familiar , this review was written with an understanding that this is a '' value-added '' gaming machine , and not a high end or middle range machine .",3,7,2,1,0
5532,5534,"that said , somethings were evidently done with lesser expensive materials so other things could be added and bring the machine into its market of the box , set up was easy .",3,7,2,1,0
5533,5535,"the box contains the computer , the charging cord and a piece of paper .",3,7,2,1,0
5534,5536,pretty basic .,3,7,2,1,0
5535,5537,turning the machine on that first time was easy and set up was nothing out of the ordinary .,3,7,2,1,0
5536,5538,the cord has a huge transformer on it and there is no short cord option .,3,7,2,1,0
5537,5539,"the machine does not generate an excessive amount of heat during prolonged periods of play or other programs that require a lot of processing operating system sits on a partition on the drive , while the `` d '' drive is named `` data '' is a 1tb hdd .",3,7,2,1,0
5538,5540,"one of the things that you will notice is that everything that comes preloaded ( operating system , anti-virus , a couple games , and a trial version of office ) resides on the c drive .",3,7,2,1,0
5539,5541,this uses up 51-52 % of that drive 's space .,3,7,2,1,0
5540,5542,"i offloaded some stuff i will never use ( disney , skype , etc . )",3,7,2,1,0
5541,5543,and it really did n't make a dent in what was resident on the sdd .,3,7,2,1,0
5542,5544,"what did make a huge difference is that my personal choice for antivirus protection is eset , not mcafee .",3,7,2,1,0
5543,5545,so offloading mcafee and installing eset brought the total ssd usage down to 47 % .,3,7,2,1,0
5544,5546,i set the machine up so that anything and everything can use the hdd aside from the operating system .,3,7,2,1,0
5545,5547,crazy ,3,7,2,1,0
5546,5548,maybe .,3,7,2,1,0
5547,5549,"i would have n't taken this step had it come with a 256 the plus side of the equation , the display is pretty sweet .",3,7,2,1,0
5548,5550,"colors are good , the graphics card delivers exactly what the description implies .",3,7,2,1,0
5549,5551,the screen does have a `` wide '' bezel .,3,7,2,1,0
5550,5552,"again , this is probably one of the trade-offs that dell needed to make to bring the machine to machine is heavy given how slim it is .",3,7,2,1,0
5551,5553,"yet the weight is not in the case , which is one of two issues i had with the unit itself .",3,7,2,1,0
5552,5554,"while i am sure it was a trade-off , the plastic body feels cheap .",3,7,2,1,0
5553,5555,tap on the frame and you get a soft hollow sound .,3,7,2,1,0
5554,5556,"i would have rather dell spent a dollar or two per machine and developed a better second , and more critical observation is that the keyboard is not great .",3,7,2,1,0
5555,5557,it 's not even good .,3,7,2,1,0
5556,5558,it is the lowest standard of adequate .,3,7,2,1,0
5557,5559,the keys give no feedback when you press them and they are so low to the case that it 's easy to lose track of where your fingers are .,3,7,2,1,0
5558,5560,"sometimes they are on a key , sometimes they are partially on a key .",3,7,2,1,0
5559,5561,"the other thing is that the keys are backlite by blue light , compounding the frustration of the extreme low profile keys .",3,7,2,1,0
5560,5562,"unless you are in a totally dark room , the blue light wave length makes seeing the keys difficult , especially if you have a vision issue .",3,7,2,1,0
5561,5563,"this , the keyboard , is the weakest part of the computer ; i would urge dell to provide a keyboard with better sensory features are a usb 2.0 on the right side and two 3.0 usb 's on the left .",3,7,2,1,0
5562,5564,an odd little partial flap covers the ethernet port .,3,7,2,1,0
5563,5565,they could have saved a few cents there and done away with the flap .,3,7,2,1,0
5564,5566,we had no problem hooking the machine up to a 32 '' monitor for a reunion and using the laptop to run a picture show last sunday .,3,7,2,1,0
5565,5567,lots of `` ooooh 's '' and `` ahhhh 's '' other feature that i do like is that you can combine this lap with another monitor for dual screens .,3,7,2,1,0
5566,5568,"i know that this is becoming a more common feature , but it works the bottom-line is that this machine gets four out of five stars .",3,7,2,1,0
5567,5569,it would have gotten five stars if it were n't for the keyboard .,3,7,2,1,0
5568,5570,"it delivers what it promises , but i think that for a few more dollars you can land a dell with a better case and keyboard .",3,7,2,1,0
5569,5571,"still , if you are on a strict budget , this is the way to again , my four out of five-star review is that machine delivers what it promises , but its keyboard is a definite  i reserve the right to change this review over the next year or so relative to issues of durability or the parts should that",3,7,2,1,0

5571,5573,"it does n't look like much closed , and it has a very lightweight , plastic feel which makes me question how durable it might be if carried around and moved a lot .",3,7,2,1,0
5572,5574,the lightweight construction does make it comfortable and easy to carry .,3,7,2,1,0
5573,5575,"it is a nice , big , full-size laptop that seems like a great model to send off to college with a responsible student .",3,7,2,1,0

5582,5584,why do manufactures stick things like mcafee on their computers ,3,7,2,1,0
5583,5585,i 'm not a fan of it and i selected to not activate it when setting up the computer .,3,7,2,1,0
5584,5586,it activated any how and disabled the anti-virus that i installed .,3,7,2,1,0
5585,5587,it also attached to the browers .,3,7,2,1,0
5586,5588,i was able to uninstall it but it was still an aggravation .,3,7,2,1,0
5587,5589,it does appear to be totally gone now .,3,7,2,1,0
5588,5590,"besides that , the computer is pretty clean without a ton of bloatware that comes on some keyboard and touchpad are both very responsive .",3,7,2,1,0

5593,5595,i do feel it needs a well protected case if you carry it somewhere since it is very thin .,3,7,2,1,0

5601,5603,"also , the backlit keyboard is fairly dim and uneven , and the actual keys are not lit , just the space in between keys .",3,7,2,1,0
5602,5604,i will say the sound is is a fair laptop with a poor quality isp panel .,3,7,2,1,0

5604,5606,this computer runs fast and is terrific for playing games .,3,7,2,1,0

5606,5608,"it tends to heat up , so i recommend that a fan be purchased to accompany it .",3,7,2,1,0
5607,5609,the sound quality is excellent .,3,7,2,1,0
5608,5610,sound effects are very clear and less `` tinny '' than on our non-gaming laptops .,3,7,2,1,0

5611,5613,this is a very solid basic laptop which is good for playing e-sport games .,3,7,2,1,0
5612,5614,out of the box the machine has a pretty standard build of windows 10 home and the setup was flawless .,3,7,2,1,0
5613,5615,it has some bloatware installed ( think candy crush ) and for better or worse it has microsoft office and mcafee antivirus installed ( but you need to buy license keys ) construction does not feel flimsy but the plastic build does not give a sense of durability .,3,7,2,1,0
5614,5616,it feels like it will shatter if dropped .,3,7,2,1,0
5615,5617,the machine is not light and the power brick is substantial .,3,7,2,1,0
5616,5618,"that said , it is not bad compared to a windows gaming rig but it is a boat anchor compared to any modern mac laptop .",3,7,2,1,0
5617,5619,the keyboard is pleasantly responsive and nicely backlit but the extra lighting around wasd is annoying if you are watching a movie in a dark room .,3,7,2,1,0
5618,5620,the display is surprisingly bright and vivid for watching 4k video .,3,7,2,1,0
5619,5621,"the trackpad , which is offset a bit to the left , is nice for one handed use .",3,7,2,1,0

5621,5623,it defaulted to medium to high settings and played smoothly at 60 frames per second .,3,7,2,1,0
5622,5624,the card was able to comfortably drive an external monitor running a reasonably high resolution ( 1920x1080 ) only gripe is the default power management .,3,7,2,1,0
5623,5625,the throttling when the machine is unplugged is clearly noticeable .,3,7,2,1,0
5624,5626,download speeds drop by about 20 percent and the machine is noticeably slower for even common tasks like opening multiple instances of file explorer .,3,7,2,1,0
5625,5627,it can be fixed using the windows power management settings but in the hands of a novice ( who does not know how to tweak windows ) this machine will feel do not trust the feel of the construction on this in the hands of a 12 year old ( or a clumsy 52 year old ) but if you are looking for,3,7,2,1,0

5635,5637,"minus the bloatware that has to be manually removed by the user , this laptop does everything .",3,7,2,1,0
5636,5638,"it runs a lot of the games i love playing ( league , tera , overwatch ) at surprisingly good frames for the price ( almost always ) i have the i5 version as well , so for games that could really utilize the multi-threading capabilities of the i7 , i can imagine it could be even definitely recommend to anyone looking",3,7,2,1,0

5683,5685,and amazon made the return very stars for amazon packing .,4,1,2,5,0
5684,5686,they just put the box the laptop came in into another box with no packing material except a piece of crumpled up paper .,4,1,2,5,0
5685,5687,"the box the laptop in was free to bounce around in this box , although it was not damaged that i could see .",4,1,2,5,0
5686,5688,i have to wonder if the packing at the amazon fulfillment center is completely done by robots ,4,1,2,5,0

5742,5744,good value in terms of price to performance ratio .,4,1,2,5,0

5796,5798,"btw , if you like to watch videos the battery will give you about 5 hours of movies .",3,4,0,0,3
5797,5799,"for normal browsing , emailing etc ... you get close to 7 hours of use which is good , imo and the screen is nice and crisp for watching the 128 gb drive being a solid state drive it is much faster than the average basic laptop so that is a nice upgrade from a basic slow 5400 rpm drive .",3,4,0,0,3
5798,5800,this can be upgraded with more ram and a larger drive but this is not designed for gaming so the 128gb ssd it comes with should work fine for the average or light business user .,3,4,0,0,3

5810,5812,"unlike todays thinner frame lighter ssd ones that have ditched disc drives , this one opted to put it back in , went with a big screen , and no touch screen features to deliver the maximum in price reduction .",3,4,0,0,3
5811,5813,"i think its great as a `` my first laptop for college '' for some folks but i wouldnt really use it as an actual portable pc unless im always going to be able to put it on a desk or angle of the screen could be better , you really only get a good view if youre sitting head on , but",3,4,0,0,3

5824,5826,"when you purchase this laptop , allow yourself a full day to set it up .",2,7,2,5,7
5825,5827,"first you will need about 3 hours to charge the battery , then windows updates will take a couple of hours .",2,7,2,5,7
5826,5828,"then it will take some time to get rid of the junk that all new computers come with ( i 'm not a gamer , so lots of games had to go ) .",2,7,2,5,7
5827,5829,"if you are a windows 10 pro , then you should be good to go .",2,7,2,5,7
5828,5830,"the last windows computer i had was xp , so win 10 took a while to get used to .",2,7,2,5,7
5829,5831,"i wo n't trade my mac for anything , but i was at the point where i needed a new laptop to take on appointments with clients , and since they are all pc users it only made sense to go with a windows computer is n't really gold at all , but more of a silvery color .",2,7,2,5,7
5830,5832,"i was worried that it would be flashy and `` in your face '' gold , but it is very caps lock button does n't let you know it is on , and that can get annoying when you accidentally hit it .",2,7,2,5,7
5831,5833,"there is also no separate numerical keypad , but maybe that is normal for laptops .",2,7,2,5,7
5832,5834,"i am more of a desktop technology is great , although about half the time it does n't recognize me the first time and i have to do it again .",2,7,2,5,7
5833,5835,"still , much faster than typing a password .",2,7,2,5,7
5834,5836,"startup is super fast , literally only a few seconds .",2,7,2,5,7
5835,5837,"i was initially only looking for a $ 400 or so laptop since this wo n't get much use , but i am glad i splurged and got something with a much better processor and a ssd for the operating laptop weighs next to nothing , and the screen is about the thickness of a few pieces of cardstock .",2,7,2,5,7
5836,5838,"really , it 's very impressive .",2,7,2,5,7
5837,5839,"i am still on my first battery charge , and have probably gotten 5-6 hours out of it , but it is warning me now that it is only downside so far is no dvd drive .",2,7,2,5,7
5838,5840,but i picked up an external asus zen drive ( ) for $ 29 and it works great .,2,7,2,5,7
5839,5841,"i do n't need it often , but my imac does n't have a drive either , so now i am all set for both computers since it is plug and , i 'm very impressed and glad that i chose this model out of the i looked at on amazon before deciding .",2,7,2,5,7
5840,5842,"i was worried that it would n't have enough ram , and apparently your warranty is void if you put more in .",2,7,2,5,7
5841,5843,but so far it is very adequate .,2,7,2,5,7
5842,5844,"if , after trying to run photoshop and a bunch of other programs all at once it seems to be lagging , then i will update my review .",2,7,2,5,7
5843,5845,"this is a punchy little laptop for its price that pleasantly surprised me in a lot of ways , and disappointed me in others .",2,7,2,5,7
5844,5846,"part of my amazement with some of it probably has to do with the fact that my everyday workhorse laptop is a couple of years old , now .",2,7,2,5,7
5845,5847,it certainly feels outdated next to this thing !,2,7,2,5,7
5846,5848,i 'll start with the good .,2,7,2,5,7
5847,5849, the laptop is really light .,2,7,2,5,7
5848,5850,"when the box came , my husband did n't believe there could really be a laptop inside .",2,7,2,5,7
5849,5851,he thought i was joking when i told him that 's what it was .,2,7,2,5,7
5850,5852,"weight does n't honestly matter to me that much because i do n't tote my laptop around , but if weight 's an issue for you -- i really ca n't imagine laptops getting much lighter than this .",2,7,2,5,7
5851,5853, it turns on fast .,2,7,2,5,7
5852,5854,really fast .,2,7,2,5,7
5853,5855,"it has the os on a solid state drive , and then a terabyte drive for storage , and the advantage to this is that solid state drives boot up super fast .",2,7,2,5,7
5854,5856,"this is a laptop that i 'd have less of a problem with shutting down regularly , because turning it back on again takes about the same amount of time as it takes my laptop to come out of sleep mode .",2,7,2,5,7
5855,5857,it 's that fast .,2,7,2,5,7
5856,5858, it packs a fair amount of power without the heat .,2,7,2,5,7
5857,5859,"i 've tested it on both overwatch and minecraft , and while it wo n't do either of those games at their best graphics settings ( or even ) , it does run them , and runs them smoothly .",2,7,2,5,7
5858,5860,"moreover , it does so without producing a lot of heat , which surprised me .",2,7,2,5,7
5859,5861,"i have ordered a fancy chill pad to go with this laptop , since i anticipate it 's going to be doing a lot of playing games with high graphics requirements , but i 'm not seeing a lot of heat issues , even without it .",2,7,2,5,7
5860,5862, i thought the whole bezel ' thing was silly until i saw this laptop 's screen .,2,7,2,5,7
5861,5863,it really does make my old laptop 's screen seem outdated and clunky .,2,7,2,5,7
5862,5864," the speakers are decent , for what they are .",2,7,2,5,7
5863,5865,"they do n't have much of a bass , but they did bring out some things in the other registers of the music i was listening to that impressed me .",2,7,2,5,7
5864,5866,"if you just want , thump , thump ' , they 're not the speakers for you , but they might hold up okay , for music that has a little more than that going on .",2,7,2,5,7
5865,5867, battery life was pretty decent .,2,7,2,5,7
5866,5868,"my roommate played overwatch for hours on it and did n't realize that it was n't plugged the bad   this is the biggest concern i have with this laptop  the charger gets really hot , and the wire itself seems flimsy .",2,7,2,5,7
5867,5869,"between the hot charger and the flimsy wire , i 'm expecting that my charger is n't going to last long .",2,7,2,5,7
5868,5870,"this is n't something i 'm terribly comfortable leaving plugged in and walking away , either .",2,7,2,5,7
5869,5871," it comes with a lot of bloatware which you then have to go through and uninstall , which is kindof a pain .",2,7,2,5,7
5870,5872,i do n't get why companies do this .,2,7,2,5,7
5871,5873,"also , it tries to push mcafee on you .",2,7,2,5,7
5872,5874,"i do n't know why companies do this , either .",2,7,2,5,7
5873,5875," the speakers , while decent , could be better .",2,7,2,5,7
5874,5876,"but i 've been saying that about my laptops for years , and have yet to own one where they are better .",2,7,2,5,7
5875,5877,"still , when my iphone has better sound , it feels like there 's room for improvement .",2,7,2,5,7
5876,5878," given how light and thin it is , i 'd actually be a little afraid to tote this thing around too much without some kind of really protective case .",2,7,2,5,7
5877,5879,it seems like it could get damaged too easily .,2,7,2,5,7
5878,5880,the laptop is a good value for what it provides .,2,7,2,5,7
5879,5881,"but , the screen and sound though fair are a little underwhelming .",2,7,2,5,7
5880,5882,my older asus has much brighter screen and it sounds a lot better than this else is top -- -- update have used this laptop for a month now .,2,7,2,5,7
5881,5883,"to be fair , the display and sound are both as one would expect other laptops in the price bracket .",2,7,2,5,7
5882,5884,"in the era of rating inflation , i will up my rating to full 5 stars .",2,7,2,5,7
5883,5885,i 've had this laptop for a few months and i love it a lot .,2,7,2,5,7
5884,5886,it boots up in seconds and makes it so easy to get on task faster .,2,7,2,5,7
5885,5887,i take it with me to school and its light enough that i do n't feel like i 'm carrying bricks .,2,7,2,5,7
5886,5888,the battery lasts for 7 hrs and i usually dont charge it for two days bc i mostly use it for school work and only play one game on steam .,2,7,2,5,7
5887,5889,"i do n't really use it for heavy software , so i do n't know how powerful it is for that.m main problem , though , is that sometimes the mousepad will stop working for a minute or two , or it will lag , but with my wireless mouse it 's fine .",2,7,2,5,7
5888,5890,it never lags or stops working .,2,7,2,5,7
5889,5891,"with the mousepad , i will try to right click but it will act like i intended to left click .",2,7,2,5,7
5890,5892,"it 's frustrating , since i dont take my wireless mouse with me , i 'm happy with it .",2,7,2,5,7
5891,5893,"as reviewed  , 8gb ram and 1tb hybrid am very happy with this little laptop .",2,7,2,5,7
5892,5894,now i 'm a person who ca n't stand the current trend towards tablets and touchscreens .,2,7,2,5,7
5893,5895,i 'm an engineering student and have a powerful desktop setup with two 219 monitors and regularly use both when i 'm doing homework .,2,7,2,5,7
5894,5896,i 'm bothered by little details and expect higher performance than the average user .,2,7,2,5,7
5895,5897,i needed a laptop to bring to my internship and carry with me to classes so i started looking for a small laptop with decent specs .,2,7,2,5,7
5896,5898,for me this laptop matched everything i needed at a reasonable price.the main selling points for me were  portable ips a nice look once i got my hands on it i had some thoughts on it .,2,7,2,5,7
5897,5899,i was pleasantly surprised by how rigid the chassis feels despite being plastic .,2,7,2,5,7
5898,5900,"when i first started using it i was n't sure i 'd like the track pad , but in use i have n't noticed it at all , it 's functioned exactly how i want it to .",2,7,2,5,7
5899,5901,"i consider the keyboard to be good , i 'd prefer a more clicky experience but i ca n't fault anything about it .",2,7,2,5,7
5900,5902,i feel fast and accurate typing on it .,2,7,2,5,7
5901,5903,i installed linux mint on it and it runs perfectly without tweaking .,2,7,2,5,7
5902,5904,the only feature that does n't work on mint is the fingerprint scanner .,2,7,2,5,7
5903,5905,"the hybrid drive is tolerable , not as quick as an ssd but i 'm not bothered by it .",2,7,2,5,7
5904,5906,"the speakers have a decent sound for a laptop , albeit a higher max volume would be conclusion this laptop offered everything i wanted at a reasonable price .",2,7,2,5,7
5905,5907,the functionality is on par with more premium offerings and it still maintains a solid build quality and good looks .,2,7,2,5,7
5906,5908,if you 're looking for a traditional laptop in this size i feel comfortable recommending it .,2,7,2,5,7
5907,5909,i plan on updating this review if anything happens as time goes on to change my opinion of it .,2,7,2,5,7
5908,5910,"this item was delivered on august 7th , advertised this laptop is extremely light , and also very discounted a few stars because  - the colors are weird .",2,7,2,5,7
5909,5911,sometimes they look dull and other times they are just simply wrong .,2,7,2,5,7
5910,5912,tried using intel hd graphics control panel to match the settings with those of an older asus laptop but they seemed to be the same already .,2,7,2,5,7
5911,5913,"some windows update , the colors are better but there 's still a faint yellowish tint .",2,7,2,5,7
5912,5914,have n't tried bios reset box it was delivered in alongside with an external cd reader was too big and with little to no protection .,2,7,2,5,7
5913,5915,"the order was handled by amazon , note  - the plug is on the power brick , which might be inconvenient in some the audio is very nice , but the location of the speakers makes it so that they may get covered when no caps lock light or alert .",2,7,2,5,7
5914,5916,replacing an 8 year old 17 '' acer i ordered two different acers only to return them both .,2,7,2,5,7
5915,5917,this asus is great .,2,7,2,5,7
5916,5918,i love the configuration .,2,7,2,5,7
5917,5919,"its elegant , fast as hell and excellent choice for home computing .",2,7,2,5,7
5918,5920,i use a macbook air at work and it has nothing on my new asus .,2,7,2,5,7
5919,5921,thanks to amazon prime and their return policy i 've got the the perfect laptop for my needs .,2,7,2,5,7
5920,5922,"great laptop , the only thing that sucks is the battery life .",2,7,2,5,7
5921,5923,"the wi-fi is super fast and connect 's to router 's far away , it boots up and shuts down in seconds .",2,7,2,5,7
5922,5924,it is so fast ! !,2,7,2,5,7
5923,5925,everything is so seemless on this computer .,2,7,2,5,7
5924,5926,"it has everything i could have ask for , with fair price tag .",2,7,2,5,7
5925,5927,i highly recommend this laptop to anyone who does n't care about bringing their charger with them .,2,7,2,5,7
5926,5928,"i also suggest you buy a screen protector for this computer , it gets fingerprints on it so easily , it not one of those displays that has a plastic cover over it like display is very nice and has a hdr like feel to it , the color depth is great , very hd .",2,7,2,5,7
5927,5929,"i would recommend you buy a case or skin for this laptop , amazon seller 's sell a nice kit that comes with a skin and screen protector for 20 $ ! !",2,7,2,5,7
5928,5930,overall good laptop so far ...,2,7,2,5,7
5929,5931,i spent a good amount of time searching for a decent laptop .,2,7,2,5,7
5930,5932,"i was stuck between a mac and an asus , i ended up going with this laptop ... was looking for a laptop with a lot of memory , i 'm becoming a coder so i needed plenty of space for my applications and programs .",2,7,2,5,7
5931,5933,"this laptop has it 's pros and cons , just like anything else does .",2,7,2,5,7
5932,5934,"i 'll start with pros  the look of it is very nice and sleek i must say , space , of course , is a big plus to me , i really just love asus as a whole honestly .",2,7,2,5,7
5933,5935,"cons  the battery life is n't as spectacular as i would think it would be , the speakers are not that great , although i stream it through my tv so that does n't really matter too much .",2,7,2,5,7
5934,5936,"sometimes , it will randomly freeze , not too long but long i will say it 's a good computer and i 'm pleased with it .",2,7,2,5,7
5935,5937,"so depending on what you are looking for in terms of use , i would suggest this one if it would suit your needs .",2,7,2,5,7
5936,5938,"i bought this laptop to decommission a dall unit from 2012 which served me very well , also being a 15.6 inch .",2,7,2,5,7
5937,5939,it was pretty difficult trying to find an all around good laptop that fit all my criteria but this one mostly does it - 80 % of the body is a light sturdy plastic .,2,7,2,5,7
5938,5940,the cover on the screen lid is a metal sheet that makes the lid pretty sturdy .,2,7,2,5,7
5939,5941,i like the weight of it and it does n't seem flimsy at all .,2,7,2,5,7
5940,5942,"it looks great and premium has a good selection of ports and a full size sd - i came from a 768p laptop which was the worst , so jumping to 1080p is an irreversible step i 've taken .",2,7,2,5,7
5941,5943,it 's very vivid and colors are n't too saturated .,2,7,2,5,7
5942,5944,"the brightness is on the low side and would be nice if it could get about 20 % brighter and it is a matte finish and gives very decent - my laptop is usually a desk queen , but i have tested the battery and it 's decent .",2,7,2,5,7
5943,5945,light use would see about 6 hours of life and hard use would be closer to hours .,2,7,2,5,7
5944,5946,the battery time estimate is erratic and sometimes seems & touchpad - so i was expecting to have to relearn a new keyboard but i guess since the main body is only slightly smaller than my last laptop so it 's almost basically all the same spacing and everything .,2,7,2,5,7
5945,5947,there is no function key lock which i seemed to take for granted previously but it 's not a big deal .,2,7,2,5,7
5946,5948,"this keyboard is backlit and has 3 different levels of brightness , brightness 1 is enough for me so +1 to that .",2,7,2,5,7
5947,5949,"the keys are n't loose and typing on them is i think satisfying , they 're somewhat quiet when pushed .",2,7,2,5,7
5948,5950,"people complain about how the power button is right next to the delete key , but for me personally i do n't find this an issue at the touch pad is n't good , your fingers do n't slide over it easily , it grabs your finger really odd .",2,7,2,5,7
5949,5951,"it clicks great , but i wo n't be trying to use is at all .",2,7,2,5,7
5950,5952,would recommend a bluetooth mouse at all times .,2,7,2,5,7
5951,5953,the fingerprint reader has n't failed & speed - my model is the i7 ...,2,7,2,5,7
5952,5954,it 's basically an i5 but with a quicker clock speed .,2,7,2,5,7
5953,5955,still dual core ( bummer ... thanks intel ) and turbo boosts to .,2,7,2,5,7
5954,5956,my base clock speed according to windows and also intel 's own driver software says .,2,7,2,5,7
5955,5957,i wish i had gotten a model with an actual i7 instead of an i5 with an i7 badge .,2,7,2,5,7
5956,5958,"fan noise is overall quiet until you run something that puts it at over 50 % cpu usage but even still , it 's manageable .",2,7,2,5,7
5957,5959,keep your power settings to ' because performance ' keeps it permanently @ model with dedicated graphics would be worth it if you 're more than a less than casual - bluetooth is quick to reconnect a mouse when turning on the laptop .,2,7,2,5,7
5958,5960,"at the same spot my last laptop was , this one gets ' signal whereas my other one would get ' to the sometimes & sound - so out of the box it does n't sound good , neither do .",2,7,2,5,7
5959,5961,"you 'll need to play music and then adjust the eq to make it sound nice , but when you do it sounds as good as you can make it .",2,7,2,5,7
5960,5962,my previous dell laptop has the best speakers and the best eq settings for headphonesspeakers i 've ever heard so i had to make lots of adjustments through the eq of this laptop to make it sound as close as i can as my last computer .,2,7,2,5,7
5961,5963,"i got it pretty close but still not perfect , but i can live with it !",2,7,2,5,7
5962,5964,"the weird this is this computer comes with like 3 programs that control eq which is very confusing , and they all are n't mutually exclusive so they all build on each other .",2,7,2,5,7
5963,5965,for this reason i recommend doing it though the ' program .,2,7,2,5,7
5964,5966,i 'm not a computer wiz by any means so i actually had a friend of mine help me pick out a new laptop .,2,7,2,5,7
5965,5967,he 's very tech savvy and basically explained to me that this is probably the best bang for my do n't do any gaming or social media on this .,2,7,2,5,7
5966,5968,i just use it to buy more stuff i do n't need on amazon and write papers in word .,2,7,2,5,7
5967,5969,maybe watch the occasional video .,2,7,2,5,7
5968,5970,pretty simple use so i do n't know how it would handle a bigger extra hard drive is cool .,2,7,2,5,7
5969,5971,again i do n't know much about computers so i just kinda have it but i 'm sure if i ever wanted to download large files or anything that would be super biometrics part is nice .,2,7,2,5,7
5970,5972,you can only have one registered print so it has to be the same finger in the same spot every time which is probably my biggest complaint .,2,7,2,5,7
5971,5973,"i might be spoiled because my phone has i think 5 registered fingerprints so i can be in a different position or use my left hand if i want , where on this computer i i definitely like it .",2,7,2,5,7
5972,5974,it 's very fast and very clear .,2,7,2,5,7
5973,5975,my old computer was a cheap walmart computer so this blows it out of the water .,2,7,2,5,7
5974,5976,i would definitely buy it again .,2,7,2,5,7
5975,5977,i was very nervous to buy this laptop because i was n't sure how it would be but i love it .,2,7,2,5,7
5976,5978,it 's worked well for the past 2 months i 've had it .,2,7,2,5,7
5977,5979,"it is very quick , especially when it boots up .",2,7,2,5,7
5978,5980,the screen has an amazing display and there are no real issues with the product .,2,7,2,5,7
5979,5981,"the only downfall is that there is no cddvd player , and the keys are n't really backlit , but other than that it functions as it should !",2,7,2,5,7
5980,5982,this laptop has a feel of very high quality .,2,7,2,5,7
5981,5983,"also , the parts have good quality for the price .",2,7,2,5,7
5982,5984,"my wife uses it for studying , and leaves everything open .",2,7,2,5,7
5983,5985,"the memory in the laptop has been able to handle everything open , and the ssd drive makes the boot time quick .",2,7,2,5,7
5984,5986,another great feature is the battery life .,2,7,2,5,7
5985,5987,it has a really long lasting battery .,2,7,2,5,7
5986,5988,this is a good laptop for someone looking for a higher end model laptop for work .,2,7,2,5,7
5987,5989,this is a pretty solid laptop .,2,7,2,5,7
5988,5990,i purchased it about a week ago and it has performed my expectations .,2,7,2,5,7
5989,5991,"i switched to this laptop from a toshiba satellite , which had such a low processing power that it took an hour for chrome to open .",2,7,2,5,7
5990,5992,this has an i7 processor which keeps its speeds crisp and quick .,2,7,2,5,7
5991,5993,"to make things easy , i will outline the .",2,7,2,5,7
5992,5994,"fast , good .",2,7,2,5,7
5993,5995,back-lit .,2,7,2,5,7
5994,5996,"lightweight , .",2,7,2,5,7
5995,5997,excellent usb port access ( 3 of them ) 5 .,2,7,2,5,7
5996,5998,"crisp , vibrant screen .",2,7,2,5,7
5997,5999,"reasonable battery life for a laptop of this size , price are a few cons though , but they are n't significant enough for me to lower my .",2,7,2,5,7
5998,6000,no cd drive - but this is something i understand since most laptops are made without them .,2,7,2,5,7
5999,6001,i noticed that anything is a bit cumbersome .,2,7,2,5,7
6000,6002,the ports seem a bit too tight for .,2,7,2,5,7
6001,6003,"poor webcam  the built-in webcam is grainy and is low far , everything else seems pretty good .",2,7,2,5,7
6002,6004,the pros definitely outweigh the cons .,2,7,2,5,7
6003,6005,we 'll see how well this laptop works over the next few months to years .,2,7,2,5,7
6004,6006,i will edit this review accordingly .,2,7,2,5,7
6005,6007,great laptop for the price .,2,7,2,5,7
6006,6008,it meet or exceeded all my expectations after reading many of the reviews on here and from other research online .,2,7,2,5,7
6007,6009,"my last laptop was an asus that had held up very well and still performs pretty well , so i wanted to stay with a brand that i 've been able to rely on .",2,7,2,5,7
6008,6010,the fingerprint sensor makes logging in a breeze and it stays up from the scan nearly instantly .,2,7,2,5,7
6009,6011,occasionally there is a little lag but nothing to bad .,2,7,2,5,7
6010,6012,this has everything i need for my usage and i 'll probably never touch more than half the memory but it 's nice to have such a large amount of storage just in case .,2,7,2,5,7
6011,6013,i 've been using it for about a month and a half and no issues have come up with it .,2,7,2,5,7
6012,6014,bought this computer ( about 3 months ago ) because i wanted something mid range that was travel friendly and could handle basic gaming .,2,7,2,5,7
6013,6015,i 'm happy to say that this laptop meets all of those criteria .,2,7,2,5,7
6014,6016,super light weight and boots up fast .,2,7,2,5,7
6015,6017,i can play league of legends for hours without any issue .,2,7,2,5,7
6016,6018,some points that may be helpful to some people  my computer crashed after playing games and having a video open in chrome .,2,7,2,5,7
6017,6019,from my experience the computer life is no where near what is advertised .,2,7,2,5,7
6018,6020,it 's more like 5-6 hours rather then 10 .,2,7,2,5,7
6019,6021,"also , a bit disappointed that it did n't come with a longer , more sturdy power cord with a ground .",2,7,2,5,7
6020,6022,just came with a standard two pronged power adapter .,2,7,2,5,7
6021,6023,"all that said though , i 'm very happy with my purchase .",2,7,2,5,7
6022,6024,"definitely a good buy if you 're looking for something travel friendly , and something that can handle standard tasks plus a little more .",2,7,2,5,7
6023,6025,"as an experienced windows 10 user , this laptop was absolutely beyond my expectations after i purchased it .",2,7,2,5,7
6024,6026,i 've had it for almost 3 months and the performance is amazing .,2,7,2,5,7
6025,6027,"it 's very fast even on slower internet speeds , and weighs very little with a very sleek design .",2,7,2,5,7
6026,6028,i can store almost anything with the storage capabilities .,2,7,2,5,7
6027,6029,i rated this laptop 5 stars because i could n't imagine anything better .,2,7,2,5,7
6028,6030,the only thing i would change if i could is the quality of the webcam .,2,7,2,5,7
6029,6031,it 's low pixel and not the best for video chatting .,2,7,2,5,7
6030,6032,the speakers are okay with adequate bass .,2,7,2,5,7
6031,6033,i 've only had dell laptops before but i will definitely be purchasing asus again in the future .,2,7,2,5,7
6032,6034,a great laptop .,2,7,2,5,7
6033,6035,the weight is a killer spec .,2,7,2,5,7
6034,6036,only 1.6 kilogram which is 1.5 times less then my previous 15 '' laptop .,2,7,2,5,7
6035,6037,the screen is ok ( better then my previous laptop but not as good as my desktop ) .,2,7,2,5,7
6036,6038,combo is good if you need both speed and storage .,2,7,2,5,7
6037,6039,i initially thought that just ssd would be a better option so it would be a little bit lighter and spent less power ( but would have less storage ) .,2,7,2,5,7
6038,6040,battery is disappointing a little bit ( it is not a long lasting one .,2,7,2,5,7
6039,6041,"i initially thought it would be enough for a day , but it is actually for 3-5 hours of work ) like the keyboard and touchpad .",2,7,2,5,7
6040,6042,as well as fingerprint which allows to log in great product .,2,7,2,5,7
6041,6043,this was purchase for my wife .,2,7,2,5,7
6042,6044,she loves it .,2,7,2,5,7
6043,6045,she is very impressed with the performance .,2,7,2,5,7
6044,6046,"the slim , light weight package is a plus .",2,7,2,5,7
6045,6047,"great screen size and not too heavy , thinner than most .",2,7,2,5,7
6046,6048,amazon prime delivery delayed,2,7,2,5,7
6047,6049,i have had this laptop for a few days now and i love it !,2,7,2,5,7
6048,6050,it is very fast .,2,7,2,5,7
6049,6051,"the only thing that i wish it had ( and i knew this before purchasing ) is a numeric keypad , so i have to use the number buttons on the top .",2,7,2,5,7
6050,6052,the fingerprint scanner is also a very nice feature .,2,7,2,5,7
6051,6053,lightweight and has solid state drive which makes it start up super fast .,2,7,2,5,7
6052,6054,"i also like that the keyboard design helps keep it clean , my previous laptop accumulated all sorts of stuff between the keys .",2,7,2,5,7
6053,6055,however it is a bit too sensitive for me and any small touch is interpreted as a movement .,2,7,2,5,7
6054,6056,also the battery life does not 6 hours as stated .,2,7,2,5,7
6055,6057,it ’ s so lightweight !,2,7,2,5,7
6056,6058,i ’ ve had it for about two months .,2,7,2,5,7
6057,6059,"don ’ t love the at all , but that ’ s easily solved by using a plug in .",2,7,2,5,7
6058,6060,"light , good size screen , fast , and reliable !",2,7,2,5,7
6059,6061,absolutely love this laptop .,2,7,2,5,7

6066,6068,"typing responsiveness is fast , log in time fast , overall performance fast .",2,7,2,5,7
6067,6069,this company has taken laptop use to a whole new level .,2,7,2,5,7
6068,6070,i use it for school and have no problem paring it via bluetooth to any other device necessary .,2,7,2,5,7
6069,6071,love this computer !,2,7,2,5,7
6070,6072,great purchase for the money .,2,7,2,5,7

6073,6075,love it .,2,7,2,5,7
6074,6076,received in good quality and with backlit keyboard .,2,7,2,5,7
6075,6077,however the excel inside need to be re-installed for the account keeps showing unlicensed .,2,7,2,5,7
6076,6078,the 15.6 inch screen looks great .,2,7,2,5,7
6077,6079,"great price , great features and a good looking laptop ! !",2,7,2,5,7
6078,6080,!,2,7,2,5,7
6079,6081,don ’ t get me wrong  this laptop is light years ahead of any computer i have ever owned .,2,7,2,5,7
6080,6082,"it is slim , light , fast , great i really wanted one that had an ssd and hard drive so i could work quickly but store a lot of photographs and at work .",2,7,2,5,7
6081,6083,but for streaming video it is terrible – the sound is very quiet and very muffled .,2,7,2,5,7
6082,6084,i don ’ t want to have to get external speakers or wear headphones every time i want to watch a show .,2,7,2,5,7
6083,6085,haven ’ t decided if i ’ m going to return it but i ’ m very disappointed .,2,7,2,5,7
6084,6086,nice screen .,2,7,2,5,7
6085,6087,like the touch pad .,2,7,2,5,7
6086,6088,nice laptop ... quick and responsive .,2,7,2,5,7
6087,6089,"overall , the laptop works well while having an appealing design -- however , there are many different factors that will make you hate this computer .",2,7,2,5,7
6088,6090,"first , the graphics are terrible -- even with intel integrated graphics , the computer can not manage to perform tasks that are simple in terms of graphical demand .",2,7,2,5,7
6089,6091,"while the computer can run videos on youtube , it can not manage to run netflix ( i have 150mbps , so it is not due to my internet connection ) .",2,7,2,5,7
6090,6092,"the image usually appears extremely blurry , and there is nothing you can do to resolve this issue .",2,7,2,5,7
6091,6093,"secondly , the speakers sound average at best , but the major issues are due to the speaker 's location , which is directly under the computer -- you must have the computer on a straight , solid surface in order to hear the sound -- placing your laptop on your bed or carpet will make the sound very difficult to hear .",2,7,2,5,7
6092,6094,"thirdly , the battery life is terrible -- if i 'm doing the slightest amount of work on my computer , the battery is dead within 1-3 hours .",2,7,2,5,7
6093,6095,"lastly , if you are into gaming , this computer fails in every category .",2,7,2,5,7
6094,6096,"obviously , this computer is not designed to handle gaming , but playing games that are very basic , two dimensional , and primitive can barely run .",2,7,2,5,7
6095,6097,"on the plus side , this laptop will fulfill all of your basic needs ( word , powerpoint , email , small projects , video chat ) reiterate , here are the pros and cons  pros  - attractive performs small application very light-up can handle overall thin  - highly fails",2,7,2,5,7
6096,6098,fastest pc out there,2,7,2,5,7
6097,6099,"good build quality , light to carry around the best audio quality , but is good for people who use it for office using it for media purposes , its not the best option .",2,7,2,5,7
6098,6100,"user observations on the asus s  the intel core processor lets me bring up applications far more quickly than on any computer i have had though the laptop frame size is what traditionally has house a 14 ” monitor , the narrow bezel allows it to hold a 15.6 ” monitor it seems is no wasted space and",2,7,2,5,7
6099,6101,it is lighter and slimmer than previous laptops i ’ ve had and has an attractive brushed metal finish that really appeals to me.my only complaint is that the delete key is right next to the power button .,2,7,2,5,7
6100,6102,"this , according to murphy ’ s law means that the likelihood that you will accidentally shut the computer off will increase in direct proportion to the importance of the document you are working on .",2,7,2,5,7
6101,6103,"for this reason , i give this computer four stars .",2,7,2,5,7
6102,6104,"aside from that , i loved it .",2,7,2,5,7
6103,6105,i bought this for my son when he started college this fall .,2,7,2,5,7
6104,6106,he loves it .,2,7,2,5,7
6105,6107,i got it 2 days after i ordered it .,2,7,2,5,7
6106,6108,"the screen is nice and big , it is extremely light weight , and it is just looks nice .",2,7,2,5,7
6107,6109,great full-featured windows 10 laptop .,2,7,2,5,7
6108,6110,"it has pretty much any port you would want , including usb for future applications .",2,7,2,5,7
6109,6111,i wish that it charged like my asus chromebook  with usb ; but i would guess it 's because it uses more power than the connection can supply .,2,7,2,5,7
6110,6112,"right out of the box i had an application for it  i installed kodi with my plex add-on , then connected it to my tv via hdmi and i was running home movies via my plex server in less than 20 with any oem laptop , there is some bloatware to it .",2,7,2,5,7
6111,6113,i uninstalled most of it .,2,7,2,5,7
6112,6114,the year subscription to mcafee is a joke  go with comodo if you want a quality security application .,2,7,2,5,7
6113,6115,graphics are not good .,2,7,2,5,7
6114,6116,battery life ,2,7,2,5,7
6115,6117,8hrs ,2,7,2,5,7
6116,6118,"lol existent , more like 8 minutes .",2,7,2,5,7
6117,6119,can not even connect to wi-fi properly .,2,7,2,5,7
6118,6120,my old hp series ... with a broken screen lol is working better .,2,7,2,5,7
6119,6121,i 've only had the laptop a few hours and i completely regret the purchase .,2,7,2,5,7
6120,6122,the only good thing is the exterior looks bomb .,2,7,2,5,7
6121,6123,this laptop has many excellent features .,2,7,2,5,7
6122,6124,it is super light so you won ’ t get shoulder strain if you want to carry it around all day in a laptop bag .,2,7,2,5,7
6123,6125,"the laptop just looks nice , from the backlit keyboard to the clear bright screen .",2,7,2,5,7
6124,6126,it starts up quickly .,2,7,2,5,7
6125,6127,"the specs are impressive and it has performed great so far with internet use , photo editing , word processing , and some steam gaming .",2,7,2,5,7
6126,6128,"i don ’ t think this would be the best system for a hardcore gaming machine , but it ’ s great for games that are not extremely system demanding .",2,7,2,5,7
6127,6129,it has a good size hard drive which is a definite plus .,2,7,2,5,7
6128,6130,"overall , an nice machine that should perform well for someone needing to do typical home computer work and light gaming .",2,7,2,5,7
6129,6131,"i would try to be as neutral as i can because even after getting the defective device , i would do a full analysis .",2,7,2,5,7
6130,6132,"when i received the laptop , the first impression was amazing but i was only able to use it foe about 10minutes .",2,7,2,5,7
6131,6133,"after configuring the windows , when i put it on charging and came back after an hour , there was no power indication and when i tried to turn it on , nothing happened .",2,7,2,5,7
6132,6134,"it was just like a dead would say when i turned it on in first place , the display was eye-catching but the brightness is only 250 nits at maximum .",2,7,2,5,7
6133,6135,"a lot of people complained about the flex in keyboard , to be honest , it was not a big deal .",2,7,2,5,7
6134,6136,"likewise , the backlit on keyboard was more than  its a mid-level laptop from asus .",2,7,2,5,7
6135,6137,i would recommend everyone to save some more bucks and go for some high end device e.g .,2,7,2,5,7
6136,6138,"xps 13 or 15 , hp spectre , lenovo x1 carbon .",2,7,2,5,7
6137,6139,downgraded to 2 stars because of the supplied operating system .,2,7,2,5,7

6162,6164,i would expect for the press to evenly push the key down but on this keyboard its a bit `` mushy '' .,1,7,2,1,3

6261,6263,i 'm happy with this purchase .,1,7,2,1,3
6262,6264,’ m not that old but i got interested in computers early on .,1,7,2,1,3
6263,6265,i was the first of my friends who owned a personal computer and one of the first owners of what could truly be called a laptop .,1,7,2,1,3
6264,6266,back then the name dell conjured up an image of something together in someone ’ s dorm room and it was years before i could take them forward to today when i ’ ve owned so many pc ’ s i ’ ve lost count and my personal laptop is a large-screen dell gaming machine that may be the most advanced laptop,1,7,2,1,3
6265,6267,needless to say these days i have no issues when i hear someone say dude you ’ re getting a one is at the edge of modern technology and thankfully for me has what it takes to use in my business in a much smaller and lighter form factor than my big dell gaming laptop and as a bonus adds a touch screen,1,7,2,1,3
6266,6268,"the keys feel tight and accurate , the track pad that tends to be misunderstood if you don ’ t read how to customize it is better than average , and the 13.3 ” screen the ideal compromise between being big enough to be useful but small enough to keep the device small and portable - the entire laptop is not much larger than",1,7,2,1,3
6267,6269,there is literally only one status light at the front edge that illuminates during charging or when the storage drive is accessing .,1,7,2,1,3

6269,6271,the only other button is an external rocker switch for the volume control .,1,7,2,1,3
6270,6272,"in terms of io ports my opinion is that what they have is adequate but not impressive but for me it ’ s all i far as specs , they speak for themselves , it runs my most intensive photovideo editing apps without hesitation ( note that the stock 8gb ram is easily user upgradable , which i upgraded to 16gb myself in",1,7,2,1,3
6271,6273,another is the lack of an optical drive which is simply a fact of life today and other than being a minor inconvenience for people like me who do graphics work i ’ d gladly give up the extra weight and use of space an internal optical drive would observation that i wouldn ’ t exactly call a downside but definitely distorted is,1,7,2,1,3
6272,6274,"no that ’ s not true , what they ’ ve done is extend the glass that covers the screen all the way to the edge purely for cosmetics but under that glass is a totally normal 13.3 ” screen surrounded by large borders and a very thick border at the bottom .",1,7,2,1,3
6273,6275,"they had plenty of real estate to actually reduce the size of the bezel and use a larger screen – but they chose not of design , the entire design philosophy of this laptop is that it can be used in multiple configurations .",1,7,2,1,3
6274,6276,that sounds really nice on paper but in real life use it turns out to be not all sunshine and rainbows .,1,7,2,1,3
6275,6277,"when used as a typical laptop ( on your lap ) the two audio speakers are on the bottom and face right into your lap , muffling the sound .",1,7,2,1,3
6276,6278,even when on a desktop the sound is muffled .,1,7,2,1,3
6277,6279,"and the fan , the value of which is questionable since my much larger dell laptop doesn ’ t have one , and the one in this unit is weak , also faces downward into your lap .",1,7,2,1,3
6278,6280,"when you prop it up like an easel the keyboard faces downward on the desktop , supported by only four tiny rubber feet .",1,7,2,1,3
6279,6281,the feet are all toward the top of the keyboard so if you press too hard when using the touchscreen the entire laptop rocks backward .,1,7,2,1,3
6280,6282,"when you use the laptop in a tent mode , there are no plastic or rubber feet along the edge that sits on the desktop ( the front edge that faces you when used as a normal laptop ) .",1,7,2,1,3
6281,6283,this doesn ’ t cause any major problems except that that painted plastic edge is subject to a lot of wear and tear and eventually looks really bad .,1,7,2,1,3
6282,6284,"and finally , if you want to use it as a tablet , well let ’ s just say it is awkward because any or all of your fingers that are holding on to the back of the unit are pressing against the keyboard , which is not a good thing for obvious can ’ t help but mention one particular flaw that",1,7,2,1,3
6283,6285,this is especially true when your unit is brand new and the first thing windows does is brings it up to date with endless updates that can last for hours .,1,7,2,1,3
6284,6286,"unfortunately dell ’ s update app doesn ’ t respect that and barges in trying to do their own updates at the same time , the worst of which was just as windows was finishing a major version update , they decided to flash the bios without asking me ( which is a sensitive and major task during which absolutely nothing else should be",1,7,2,1,3
6285,6287,this caused windows to roll back and undo everything it took almost an hour to do .,1,7,2,1,3
6286,6288,i ’ m lucky that the bios update didn ’ t fail and brick the entire computer .,1,7,2,1,3
6287,6289,for them to permit such a conflict in software design is don ’ t take sides when it comes to the pc vs mac debate .,1,7,2,1,3
6288,6290,"i own both plus an ipad , and i use them daily .",1,7,2,1,3
6289,6291,both can be equally adept for people who work in the graphic arts with a lot of it boiling down to personal style and work habits .,1,7,2,1,3
6290,6292,with all that in mind i have certain editing specialty apps that i want to use that are pc only and i have yet to finds a pc equivalent to my ipad pro that lets me do pen based editing on a touch screen .,1,7,2,1,3
6291,6293,"this computer is that bridge for me and has enough power and resolution ( not the best but good enough ) that i decided to load it up with all of my photo and graphic apps and dedicate it as my personal biggest downside is how much it costs , it would be a strong contender at under 500 bucks but there are",1,7,2,1,3
6292,6294,"one impressive plus is that this model has wonderfully easy and well documented accessibility for upgrading memory , storage , battery and just about everything else , something the pretty , trendy ( and expensive ) models from some other brands have as a strike against them.the unit i ’ m i just got in early 2018 was made in late 2017 and is",1,7,2,1,3

6299,6301,"according to passmark numbers , this cpu is not bad at 4gb is enough for most home uses like browsing , email , word processing , spreadsheets , etc. , 8gb is preferred if you plan to do occasional photo editing and normal video editing ( using , say , microsoft moviemaker ) .",1,7,2,1,3

6301,6303,it will help with quick boot up and wake from sleep or hibernation .,1,7,2,1,3
6302,6304,"also , it will help with quick shutdown , sleep , and hibernation .",1,7,2,1,3
6303,6305,"obviously , copying pictures and videos from your will be very fast too .",1,7,2,1,3
6304,6306,"however , a regular hard drive for a similarly priced laptop would have been 1tb or larger .",1,7,2,1,3
6305,6307,"personally , i do n't need a larger drive because i regularly take double backups and delete from the and sharp screen .",1,7,2,1,3
6306,6308,i am very am not impressed by the speakers .,1,7,2,1,3
6307,6309,they are on the bottom surface of the keyboard and do n't produce good sound .,1,7,2,1,3
6308,6310,expect to use headphones or external speakers .,1,7,2,1,3
6309,6311,i would recommend external wireless blue tooth well .,1,7,2,1,3
6310,6312,sound quality depends on your headset or padi did n't have any problems with the touch pad .,1,7,2,1,3
6311,6313,i could easily perform all gestures supported by windows 10 and the system performed well as expected and did n't notice any well as expected and did n't notice any problem .,1,7,2,1,3
6312,6314,i tested with windows paint 3d app and everything worked just as you would and comfortable in all respects .,1,7,2,1,3
6313,6315,"thin , light , and easily like the fact that the brick is small and easily portable in a button is a little too small and hard to works fine .",1,7,2,1,3
6314,6316,"windows 10 face recognition ( for logging into the system ) works very well and extremely articulated hinge allows this computer to be placed like a tent or make it a wish it came with a display port , but only hdmi is usb 3.0 ports and 1 usb 2.0 port are available .",1,7,2,1,3
6315,6317,i wonder why not all usb 3.0 ports .,1,7,2,1,3
6316,6318,i am so excited with this laptop .,1,7,2,1,3
6317,6319,it is a medium to high end intel laptop that comes with windows 10 .,1,7,2,1,3
6318,6320,"i have used dell equipment in the past and in my opinion , they are not sexy as some others , but were work horse that are solid and reliable .",1,7,2,1,3
6319,6321,"my main computer now is a mac ( yes i am in the apple orbit ) , so often times i compared other computers to apple standard .",1,7,2,1,3
6320,6322,"this is one of the rare times i am excited about a laptop that was not from start with , the screen is gorgeous .",1,7,2,1,3
6321,6323,"high resolution ( 1920x1080 ) and deep color , this makes everything beautiful from reading a magazine to watch movie a wonderful experience .",1,7,2,1,3
6322,6324,intel i5 and 256gb ssd help make the computer really fast .,1,7,2,1,3
6323,6325,"8gb is so so , i wish i have more but for now , it seems sufficient .",1,7,2,1,3
6324,6326,"the whole computer is a bit heavier and bulkier than some other in the same class , but i believe there is a good reason for that  touch screen ! it took a little bit to get used to , and i do worry that i will get used to this and start touching other laptop 's screen !",1,7,2,1,3
6325,6327,think of a giant tablet with a keyboard attached .,1,7,2,1,3
6326,6328,"the screen is very responsive , browser windows closes or navigate nicely , just a light touch .",1,7,2,1,3
6327,6329,"i worried for a minute that my finger is too big for the screen , but that was not the case .",1,7,2,1,3
6328,6330,"the screen navigate just like an ipad , awesome !",1,7,2,1,3
6329,6331,"of course , if you do n't want to use the touch screen , the keyboard and touch pad let you operate like a regular laptop .",1,7,2,1,3
6330,6332,"indefinite viewing position too.the laptop comes generously with 3 usb and a hdmi port , so you can actually hook to your tv and make it a media center .",1,7,2,1,3
6331,6333,"one thing that is different ( and it took me a minute to figure out )  the power on button is on the bottom right side instead of keyboard all , i am excited about this laptop and have used it regularly .",1,7,2,1,3
6332,6334,my macbook pro is kind of gathering dust right now .,1,7,2,1,3
6333,6335,got this on sale for $ 650 at my local microcenter .,1,7,2,1,3
6334,6336,"was looking for expandable ram and quad core i5 , this happened to be the heapest option for what i was looking for .",1,7,2,1,3
6335,6337,"its a great machine , fast and smooth , havent had any issues so far .",1,7,2,1,3
6336,6338,"its light and easy to carry , its made of plastic with a 1080 display , the screen has some good viewing ram is supposed to be easily expandable ( pull off the back and you can plug in your card ) comes with two slots , one for the 8gb and a free upgrade of the biggest reasons i like this",1,7,2,1,3
6337,6339,just turn on your laptop and look at the screen and your in .,1,7,2,1,3
6338,6340,"no messing with passwords or fingerprint sensor , its really fast like the password isnt even concern is the fan kicking in and machine getting pretty warm ( 79c ) , hoefully it doesnt become too much of a problem , but ive had this machine for a few weeks now and has only heated up twice .",1,7,2,1,3
6339,6341,this is my first dell machine and its actually been one of the better laptops ive used .,1,7,2,1,3
6340,6342,i would recommend buying this .,1,7,2,1,3
6341,6343,"in many ways i really like this computer , but the terrible battery life and other issues bump it down to a three star what do i love about it ",1,7,2,1,3
6342,6344,"it 's super light , set-up was a snap , screen resolution is great , the flip function ( tablet mode ) works overall very well with the hinge being easy to maneuver , but tight enough to hold the angle you want .",1,7,2,1,3
6343,6345,"the touch screen works well , the keyboard feels great .",1,7,2,1,3
6344,6346,"i am not a huge windows fan , but i ca n't bump down the rating due to here are the things that i do n't love  the speakers are on the underside of the computer .",1,7,2,1,3
6345,6347,"to me , this makes the audio sound a little odd , especially when it 's in tablet mode .",1,7,2,1,3
6346,6348,"when in tablet mode , the main volume control is on the back flip , so that can be a little awkward .",1,7,2,1,3
6347,6349,i also do n't love that the power switch is right next to the volume control switch .,1,7,2,1,3
6348,6350,"i know they tend to be placed next to each other , and i really do n't understand why since you will undoubtedly accidentally hit the power when aiming for the volume .",1,7,2,1,3
6349,6351,another weird design issue is when you put it in tablet mode the `` dell '' logo is upside-down .,1,7,2,1,3
6350,6352,"i do n't care that it 's upside-down , but it was just a funny design flaw that we noticed .",1,7,2,1,3
6351,6353,"most importantly , the battery life is bad , especially if you are watching videos .",1,7,2,1,3
6352,6354,"it does charge pretty fast though , but i often find myself having to plug it in to watch a video .",1,7,2,1,3
6353,6355,"another thing i noticed is that it can get very hot , which i recognized when it was in laptop mode and it was sitting on my lap .",1,7,2,1,3
6354,6356,it has gotten so hot that it was quite uncomfortable and i had to move it off or lift it up for a while .,1,7,2,1,3
6355,6357,"when it does heat up , the fan will turn on , and it 's pretty loud .",1,7,2,1,3
6356,6358,the fan also turns on way more than any other computer i 've ever had .,1,7,2,1,3
6357,6359,"it mostly seems to turn on when watching recap , i love the flip function , touch screen and how lightweight it is .",1,7,2,1,3
6358,6360,"i do n't love the terrible battery life , some bad design issues and tendency to run hot .",1,7,2,1,3
6359,6361,i have been using this laptop for the past few weeks and have nothing but great things to say about it ! !,1,7,2,1,3
6360,6362,"for the past several years , i have been using an imac desktop , but there were times i wished i had a laptop , so i would n't be tied to my dell inspiron has been great .",1,7,2,1,3
6361,6363,the laptop is very thin and lightweight .,1,7,2,1,3
6362,6364,very sleek looking and easy to throw in a carry all bag or computer sleeve and run out the door .,1,7,2,1,3
6363,6365,set up was very easy and took about 20 minutes .,1,7,2,1,3
6364,6366,following the prompts made it basically effortless to get up and running .,1,7,2,1,3
6365,6367,"one of the features that is new , is the facial recognition to sign in .",1,7,2,1,3
6366,6368,user looks into the screen and the computer picks up on features to sign them in .,1,7,2,1,3
6367,6369,you can also have a backup passcode to enter if your face is not recognized .,1,7,2,1,3
6368,6370,this is nice if you are the main user but have someone else in the household that would occasionally use the battery life has been good .,1,7,2,1,3
6369,6371,"it has been disconnected for about 4-5 hours , laptop was connected to wireless internet and microsoft running and still the laptop had battery to give before it was plugged back in .",1,7,2,1,3
6370,6372,the bottom of the computer did get pretty warm on my lap while i was resting it there work on it .,1,7,2,1,3
6371,6373,i eventually moved the la top to the coffee table because of the heat .,1,7,2,1,3
6372,6374,"once connected back to the power source , the battery charges very quickly .",1,7,2,1,3
6373,6375,it was back up to 100 % power in no time .,1,7,2,1,3
6374,6376,"that is great if your run your battery low and do n't have time to sit and wait for a of the features that took some time to get a hang of , but i ended up loving , were the touchpad and the touchscreen .",1,7,2,1,3
6375,6377,the touchpad is very sensitive .,1,7,2,1,3
6376,6378,while typing if you hover close enough to the touch pad it will move the mouse and change your screen .,1,7,2,1,3
6377,6379,"for the first few days that was very frustrating , but once i figured out how to adjust my hands to stay off the pad , it has not happened very much , if at all .",1,7,2,1,3
6378,6380,the sensitive touch pad is actually something i like now that that i have learned how to control and navigate with it .,1,7,2,1,3
6379,6381,i can quickly jump from screen to screen or to text within a other new addition to the laptop that i have not had previously is the touchscreen option .,1,7,2,1,3
6380,6382,that is great ! !,1,7,2,1,3
6381,6383,having the ability to move around on the screen by touching the actual screen is outstanding .,1,7,2,1,3
6382,6384,you can use the touchscreen feature while in laptop mode or flip the screen over and have in tablet mode .,1,7,2,1,3
6383,6385,"it takes virtually 1 second to transition the laptop to a having a laptop that is for personal use , mostly email , online , and microsoft office this laptop is perfect .",1,7,2,1,3
6384,6386,"it is fast , lightweight and easy to use .",1,7,2,1,3
6385,6387,there are so many features that we have n't even touched on yet but i ca n't imagine that i wo n't also like those once i get to needing them .,1,7,2,1,3
6386,6388,i am by no means a computer person or guru but i have been working on a computer for many years and this is by far one of the best laptops i have used !,1,7,2,1,3
6387,6389,! very happy with this product and recommend it highly .,1,7,2,1,3
6388,6390,this review covers the etc .,1,7,2,1,3
6389,6391,etc .,1,7,2,1,3
6390,6392,since amazon seems to lump reviews for different models together .,1,7,2,1,3
6391,6393,"dell 's unfortunate naming schemes do n't help case you had n't noticed , notebook computers have gone off the deep end lately , trying to prove they 're all sorts of things they 're not , like tablets , or the ridiculous `` tented '' device you see in the product image .",1,7,2,1,3
6392,6394,"we get it , nearly every laptop has hinges that are fully articulated now .",1,7,2,1,3
6393,6395,it 's neither novel nor particularly useful most of the time .,1,7,2,1,3
6394,6396,"let 's get on with it.as a laptop , this is pretty decent .",1,7,2,1,3
6395,6397,"it has slim , `` ultrabook '' dimensions , although i think a proper ultrabook is at least somewhat alloy in construction rather than plain plastic .",1,7,2,1,3
6396,6398,"the build quality of this laptop is fair , but nothing more .",1,7,2,1,3
6397,6399,"it feels a lot better than a $ 300 device , but is well behind a $ device .",1,7,2,1,3
6398,6400,for what dell is asking i believe they could have tried a little harder on this front .,1,7,2,1,3
6399,6401,"however , it feels solid , has a nice screen , and the keyboard is tolerable .",1,7,2,1,3
6400,6402,it 's a decent notebook .,1,7,2,1,3
6401,6403,"i do n't like the massive bezel along the bottom of the screen ( it 's the one you see the upside-down `` dell '' logo on the top of the tented version ) , and wish the screen format was just a little taller to actually use that real estate .",1,7,2,1,3
6402,6404,"the screen is otherwise quite good , though , and the touch screen is very lot of the cost comes from the inclusion of the newest core i5 processor .",1,7,2,1,3
6403,6405,"i have found it to be a pretty capable mobile processor , which handled my photo editing software well enough ( although the 13 '' screen is too small for proper editing , it works in a pinch ) and is fast and smooth for loading lots of browser tabs , streaming video and other notebook things .",1,7,2,1,3
6404,6406,"it 's not a gaming rig , of course .",1,7,2,1,3
6405,6407,i do find the fresh and up-to-date windows 10 os boots exceptionally quickly and is responsive and easy to this device is a curious mix of old and new .,1,7,2,1,3
6406,6408,"it 's a mid-range dell notebook , and as such is made with some sub-par materials and build quality .",1,7,2,1,3
6407,6409,that 's the old .,1,7,2,1,3
6408,6410,"the new is that , unfortunately , it tries to be hip by ( literally ) standing on its head .",1,7,2,1,3
6409,6411,"it 's a fast and light notebook that will handle most of what you throw at it , but please for the love of all that 's good , do n't flip it upside down and stare that that upside-down dell logo while you 're streaming netflix .",1,7,2,1,3
6410,6412,"it 's a laptop , people .",1,7,2,1,3
6411,6413,"update ( )  the keyboard stops working mid game and i have to restart the computer , the computer is overheating ( it got up to 152 degrees fahrenheit ) , and the speakers are n't great .",3,7,5,5,0
6412,6414,i called asus and they said to send this one back .,3,7,5,5,0

6415,6417,i am coming from a lenovo .,3,7,5,5,0
6416,6418,i chose this laptop because a ) it was recommended by my gamer friends to get an asus b ) the larger ssd is good for the os and the game since they are both large files .,3,7,5,5,0
6417,6419,i also wanted the speed from the ssd c ) sacrificed on the 1060 graphics but the 1050 is much higher than what i have now and looks great d ) the keyboard is awesome ! ! !,3,7,5,5,0
6418,6420,no more boring red keys .,3,7,5,5,0
6419,6421,i checked this out at a best buy store before i after 2 weeks of use  graphics are beautiful on the 1050 ( i do not regret not spending the extra $ $ for 1060 graphics ) .,3,7,5,5,0
6420,6422,loading screens are so fast and the game refreshes so much faster ! !,3,7,5,5,0
6421,6423,trackpad is better ( although i use a mouse ) .,3,7,5,5,0
6422,6424,took getting used to the font on the keyboard but that took just a couple of days .,3,7,5,5,0
6423,6425,big upgrade from my lenovo .,3,7,5,5,0
6424,6426,i did experience my keyboardmouse locking up for a few seconds in wow during a but i think this had to do with the overlay from discord or having to update the driver ( went to geforce 's website -- here you can download their program and optimize based on your game ) .,3,7,5,5,0
6425,6427,the battery is n't the greatest but i do n't mind since i play near an outlet and i 'm not sure how much battery someone could expect out of a gaming laptop anyway .,3,7,5,5,0
6426,6428,yes the laptop gets loud at times but that is because it is using the fan so it does not give out !,3,7,5,5,0
6427,6429,i am happy with my multi purple backlit keys  ),3,7,5,5,0
6428,6430,i bought this notebook while my daughter was in usa .,3,7,5,5,0
6429,6431,"since i live in brazil , she brought it to me 2 weeks ago .",3,7,5,5,0
6430,6432,"i 'm not a gamer , i 'm a software developer , so i need a fast machine to do my daily work , and gamers notebooks usually fits this requirement .",3,7,5,5,0
6431,6433,"i was an asus fan back in the 90 's , when i used to assembly desktop machines with parts from different brands .",3,7,5,5,0
6432,6434,"asus was my preferred brand for the motherboards in that time , so i supposed that asus notebooks would provide the same quality that i was used to , back in those days .",3,7,5,5,0
6433,6435,"well , it seems that my expectations was too high .",3,7,5,5,0
6434,6436,"the machine is fast , of course , but i faced two problems that i would like to share  when you `` click '' in the touchpad , it is like there is something loose inside that hits the plastic chassis mostly where you stand your wrist , causing an weird sensation .",3,7,5,5,0
6435,6437,the other problem is a `` high frequency '' noise coming from the notebook when the cpu is under some load .,3,7,5,5,0
6436,6438,"i searched the online forums , and this sound seems to be pretty common in asus notebooks , and they call it `` coil whine '' sound .",3,7,5,5,0
6437,6439,"it seems to be harmless , but very annoying .",3,7,5,5,0
6438,6440,the loose touchpad also seems to be common for those notebooks .,3,7,5,5,0
6439,6441,"unfortunately , asus warranty does not cover brazil , so seems that i 'll have to live with those problems .",3,7,5,5,0
6440,6442,"they are not showstoppers , but they should not exist at all in a quality product .",3,7,5,5,0
6441,6443,another problem was regarding the ( mostly useless ) asus support .,3,7,5,5,0
6442,6444,"i replaced the original ssd with a ( higher capacity ) samsung evo 970 , meaning that i had to do a fresh install of windows 10 .",3,7,5,5,0

6444,6446,"in the end of the install , it always raised an error .",3,7,5,5,0
6445,6447,"i contacted asus support by chat , and they gave me all kind of useless answers , like installing asus live , send it to rma ( in my case , this would not be possible ) , etc .",3,7,5,5,0
6446,6448,"i was sure that there was no hardware problem , since the touchpad worked fine in the bios setup screen , and also worked fine in the pre-installed windows on the original ssd .",3,7,5,5,0
6447,6449,"it took me more than a day digging into forums , etc until i finally found that i had to install the intel io driver before installing the precision touchpad driver .",3,7,5,5,0
6448,6450,this was n't mentioned anywhere .,3,7,5,5,0
6449,6451,"this solved the problem , but i wonder how asus support missed this information !",3,7,5,5,0
6450,6452,"so , i wonder if buying an asus notebook was the best choice ...",3,7,5,5,0
6451,6453,"great laptop , very competent for gaming and casual use .",3,7,5,5,0
6452,6454,love the 256gb ssd + 1tb combo - startup is super fast .,3,7,5,5,0

6456,6458,the lid has the rog decal in silver - no screaming red logos on this one .,3,7,5,5,0

6468,6470,running games and putting the fan in overboost mode will bring this down.the only area that is a little irritating with this laptop is the installed bloatware .,3,7,5,5,0

6658,6660,"with the computer almost dead , i went to bed and the had charged it by the morning , so it certainly works when it 's not drawing power .",1,0,2,1,3
6659,6661,"good to know i probably wo n't have to depend on the proprietary charger if it goes bad or gets inclusion of bluetooth and wireless makes it pretty easy to hook up plenty of externals , and my 60 % mechanical bluetooth keyboard worked swimmingly .",1,0,2,1,3
6660,6662,"i really thought i would need it for this machine , but to be honest , if you 're trying to incognito type a bunch of notes while you 're on calls with clients , this keyboard is a hell of a lot quieter , and is honestly kind of incredible .",1,0,2,1,3
6661,6663,"there 's a satisfying punch on the keys , and they seem spaced and sized well .",1,0,2,1,3
6662,6664,"the throw on the keys is obviously very short , but you do get the feeling you 're typing and not just touching a flat surface .",1,0,2,1,3
6663,6665,feels just as good as the macbook pro .,1,0,2,1,3
6664,6666,i 'm a very large person and it 's working out for me .,1,0,2,1,3
6665,6667,"i 'm a solid on a variety of mechanical keyboards , and my first ten runs with this thing were frankly ridiculous  i keyed in at just shy of 101 .",1,0,2,1,3
6666,6668,"it 's a great keyboard , and i think i might just have to leave the 60 % for longer trips when i know i 'll want to use the laptop more as a desktop than anything else .",1,0,2,1,3
6667,6669,"i will be adding a numerical mechanical bluetooth keypad because of my data entry needs , but this little guy will do amazingly well for the glut of emails and notes i have to take throughout a day.the screen is great .",1,0,2,1,3
6668,6670,"not as good as the macbook , but close enough for work that it does n't mater .",1,0,2,1,3
6669,6671,off axis viewing is is true to color and you 'll be able to collaborate on a screen if need be .,1,0,2,1,3
6670,6672,"the size takes almost full advantage , beveling is super small and looks great .",1,0,2,1,3
6671,6673,"i got mine in the white finish because the silver was n't available , and i 'll deal with that because it was cheaper .",1,0,2,1,3
6672,6674,"i do n't do any sort of content creation or color work , but everything looks pretty great , almost up to snuff with my desktop monitor .",1,0,2,1,3
6673,6675,"no , you do n't get the density of other laptop screens , but brightness is acceptable and color and contrast are great , and the 1080p panel scales well and keeps the battery life be honest , it feels like a lightweight version of the macbook pro .",1,0,2,1,3
6674,6676,"the build quality is n't quite up to that snuff , but it is very solid , i 'm sure it will hold up nearly as well , and i 'll take the weight tradeoff since the warranty is so cheap .",1,0,2,1,3
6675,6677,"you do n't get the same peripherals , but to be honest almost nobody actually uses all those freaking thunderbolt ports , can we all stop pretending ",1,0,2,1,3
6676,6678,"the company wanted to get me into one of those , but i really do n't like their ecosystem or their interface .",1,0,2,1,3
6677,6679,apple has just never been as intuitive for me as it seems to be for everyone else .,1,0,2,1,3
6678,6680,"anyway , since every dollar i spend eventually comes out of my paycheck , i wanted to find something reasonable that would last through a long flight with snappy performance and would n't make me look like a teenager with a gaming laptop .",1,0,2,1,3
6679,6681,"grabbing a macbook of any sort was going to be another 1-2000 dollars , and the performance would have been guess that 's kind of the thing here .",1,0,2,1,3
6680,6682,"if you need something that actually gets real work done , looks professional , is incredibly lightweight and compact , and wo n't need to be plugged into the wall all day , this is as good as it gets in this price point .",1,0,2,1,3
6681,6683,"you can spend twice as much for the exact same hardware specs and a prettier screen with that sweet apple logo , but you 'll be laughing with the extra thousand dollars you have in your pocket when some jobs acolyte is looking for a wall charger and you 've still got 30 % .",1,0,2,1,3
6682,6684,where do i even start with this thing ,1,0,2,1,3
6683,6685,"it 's so nice , literally , have your friend pick it up and watch their face .",1,0,2,1,3
6684,6686,they will be amazed at how light it is .,1,0,2,1,3
6685,6687,then show them the benchmarks ... and mention the battery life .,1,0,2,1,3
6686,6688,"this laptop has made my mind  the display is very vibrant , even though it 's nowhere close to being oled , the blacks are very deep , and everything is very vibrant .",1,0,2,1,3
6687,6689,"not sure how color accurate it is , but man it looks awesome .",1,0,2,1,3
6688,6690,"it 's 1080p , which is totally fine , it 's only 13.3 '' and you only see pixels if you put your face up to the screen .",1,0,2,1,3
6689,6691,"the bezels are very small , which makes it seem super futuristic .",1,0,2,1,3
6690,6692,"it does n't get super bright , but for me , that is n't too big of a deal .",1,0,2,1,3
6691,6693,"i came from a 2014 13 '' macbook pro retina display , and it 's not quite ' quality , but that 's why this gets 12 hours of battery and the mac gets  personally , if i had to make the purchase again , i 'd opt for the gray one .",1,0,2,1,3
6692,6694,"the white is very pretty , but it 's less than a week old at this point and it is a little dirty already .",1,0,2,1,3
6693,6695,"not a huge deal as i wipe it down when i see a smudge , but just make sure to always have handy wipes available if you want your laptop to look good .",1,0,2,1,3
6694,6696,"the overall look is n't gaudy , and nobody will recognize it from a distance , but man the ' insignia on the lid looks classy .",1,0,2,1,3
6695,6697,like really good .,1,0,2,1,3
6696,6698,"the plastic bezel is okay , not my favorite , but what are you gon na do  build quality  the display flexes a lot !",1,0,2,1,3
6697,6699,like you 're not ready for it .,1,0,2,1,3
6698,6700,"however , other than that , it feels premium , yet cheap at the same time .",1,0,2,1,3
6699,6701,"when you take the laptop out of your bag for the first time of the day , you 'll feel the cold metal , but then you start to feel that it 's plastic .",1,0,2,1,3
6700,6702,"the magnesium alloy is nice , however , it can be felt as plastic , which is the carbon layer on top of the magnesium .",1,0,2,1,3
6701,6703,"not a huge deal , but something you might want to watch out for .",1,0,2,1,3
6702,6704,"battery  it 's crazy long , crazy crazy .",1,0,2,1,3
6703,6705,i unplug it at 645 am and use it all day until about 4 pm and it 's only at 40 % .,1,0,2,1,3
6704,6706,i 'm so not even sure how they made it so good .,1,0,2,1,3
6705,6707,"it 's 72 wh , which is huge , especially for a laptop that 's so small and that only has a 1080p display .",1,0,2,1,3
6706,6708,most other laptops at this price point and especially ones that are this thin and light do n't even come close to the battery life of this  the new core processors are just awesome .,1,0,2,1,3
6707,6709,"they have very little power draw , yet they 're super powerful .",1,0,2,1,3
6708,6710,my old mac had a 4th-generation dual-core i7 .,1,0,2,1,3
6709,6711,"this thing more than doubled the performance of that , it 's incredible .",1,0,2,1,3
6710,6712,"the 8gb of ram gets used up quickly , so i 'd recommend upgrading to 16gb by yourself , just buy another 8gb sodimm on amazon , and pop it in & trackpad  the keyboard is pretty good , a bit mushy , but personally , i prefer this .",1,0,2,1,3
6711,6713,"the trackpad is using windows precision drivers , which makes it very usable .",1,0,2,1,3
6712,6714,"it feels natural , not quite as good as the mac trackpad , but honestly way better than i would have thought .",1,0,2,1,3
6713,6715,lg really hit it out of the park on this  absolutely pick up this laptop if you 're a performance enthusiast and someone who wants a 2lb laptop that has enough power for the day and enough battery to let you work for more than 12 hours straight .,1,0,2,1,3
6714,6716,"buy one , now .",1,0,2,1,3
6715,6717,you wo n't regret it .,1,0,2,1,3
6716,6718,i promise .,1,0,2,1,3
6717,6719,this was an upgrade for my wife .,1,0,2,1,3
6718,6720,i initially had settled on a reconditioned xps 13 but the more i read about the re-sellers the more it sound like a crap shot .,1,0,2,1,3
6719,6721,"also , portability was the biggest factor for her so the lg gram seemed the best fit .",1,0,2,1,3
6720,6722,i added an usb fingerprint scanner for $ 30 .,1,0,2,1,3
6721,6723,"i was impressed the light weight , compactness and general speed of the machine .",1,0,2,1,3
6722,6724,"also , ips screen is just brilliant .",1,0,2,1,3
6723,6725,makes me hate my work laptop ( dell ) .,1,0,2,1,3
6724,6726,lg did not pack that much bloat software on it and i only had to uninstall some unnecessary software .,1,0,2,1,3
6725,6727,with machines like this around it really makes you wonder how apple sells it 's anymore .,1,0,2,1,3
6726,6728,"fashion victims  no , this is not a gaming laptop but let 's be real , for gaming , you should be using a desktop .",1,0,2,1,3
6727,6729,this laptop is exactly what i need .,1,0,2,1,3
6728,6730,i have a powerful gaming desktop and i do all the heavy stuff on it .,1,0,2,1,3
6729,6731,but i need a laptop to use in the meeting and do some lightweight coding on the go .,1,0,2,1,3
6730,6732,this lg gram is as light as a real notebook .,1,0,2,1,3
6731,6733,"i install ubuntu on it and every thing works fine except the charging port , since i did n't have a 45w power brick , this is not a big deal for me .",1,0,2,1,3
6732,6734,"speaking of the battery , i use it on the work and i can even leave the charge in my house and it can still last from 9am to 6am without any , i have two small ) the palmrest is kinda loose and create some noise when press it .",1,0,2,1,3
6733,6735,i fastened the two screws on the bottom and fixed ) the speaker is bad .,1,0,2,1,3
6734,6736,use headphone .,1,0,2,1,3
6735,6737,"excellent product - lightweight , great battery .",1,0,2,1,3
6736,6738,the only reason for a 4 star is i wish they had a model with more memory and larger hard drive .,1,0,2,1,3
6737,6739,i 'd buy that also !,1,0,2,1,3
6738,6740,"otherwise , no complaints !",1,0,2,1,3
6739,6741,absolutely perfect for our mobile business laptop .,1,0,2,1,3
6740,6742,"quick , light , thin and error free .",1,0,2,1,3
6741,6743,quality is similar to apple products .,1,0,2,1,3
6742,6744,awesome computer .,1,0,2,1,3
6743,6745,light and fast .,1,0,2,1,3
6744,6746,light and powerful battery .,1,0,2,1,3
6745,6747,but why the 8g memory made up by 4g on board and 4g on the slot ,1,0,2,1,3
6746,6748,"this means you can only remove the 4g memory and add a 8g memory , only 12g for you .",1,0,2,1,3
6747,6749,why this stupid design used for this pc ,1,0,2,1,3
6748,6751,all things considered it is a very nice laptop .,1,0,2,1,3
6749,6752,"the build quality is good , the screen is good and the keyboard also .",1,0,2,1,3
6750,6753,in general everything `` just works '' which is exactly what i wanted .,1,0,2,1,3
6751,6754,i 'm not sure if the claimed 22hours of battery life is possible under linux but it certainly does well over 14 because at one point i had it running for about that long thinking it was powered up and then discovering that the wall socket was n't switched on.i bought this expecting to be forced to run windows 10 on it - which,1,0,2,1,3
6752,6755,to my pleased surprise when i tried to install xubuntu 17.10 it installed flawlessly and the upgrade shortly afterwards to 18.04 was equally have kept w10 on it too to dual boot and w10 works fine too .,1,0,2,1,3
6753,6756,the upgrade to the latest w10 version was also problem free .,1,0,2,1,3
6754,6757,this is a sweet little machine .,1,0,2,1,3
6755,6758,"as a long-time mac user , i immediately categorize this as an `` air class machine '' , and if you were considering this or a 13-inch air , this stacks up well .",1,0,2,1,3
6756,6759,"( i am comparing to a 13-inch air with 256gb ssd storage , which on the apple site right now is $ 1199 .",1,0,2,1,3
6757,6760,) some .,1,0,2,1,3
6758,6761,both have 8gb of memory and a 256 gb ssd hard drive2 .,1,0,2,1,3
6759,6762,"this ( the lg ) weighs about 2 pounds , and the air weighs about 3 pounds .",1,0,2,1,3
6760,6763,so that makes the lg better for schlepping .,1,0,2,1,3
6761,6764,the lg has a touch screen and fingerprint sensor ( the power button ) 4 .,1,0,2,1,3
6762,6765,hmmm .,1,0,2,1,3
6763,6766,"my lg says that it has an intel cpu , which is and an max turbo of 4.0 ghz .",1,0,2,1,3
6764,6767,but the listing for this machine says that it 's intel .,1,0,2,1,3
6765,6768,huh .,1,0,2,1,3
6766,6769,"i was shipped a , which is a nicer machine , with a srp of $ 1399 , according to the lg website .",1,0,2,1,3
6767,6770,"well , that explains why it 's silver and not , okay , it 's time for me to stop , since i ca n't tell you about the machine you 're look at the actual chips being used , the capacity of the hard drive , the available screen resolutions , the ports , and type features .",1,0,2,1,3
6768,6771,"like another reviewer , i ended up with an upgraded version of the base-model you see here .",1,0,2,1,3
6769,6772,"so , while i ordered this one , i actually received the  is super compact , super thin , and super is great for work ( especially if you commute via public transportation when every ounce counts ) , great for students with backpacks full of chemistry and calculus books ( this adds very little extra weight )",1,0,2,1,3
6770,6773,it is a nice touch .,1,0,2,1,3
6771,6774,( it is especially great for the student in your life who is sharing a dorm room and trying to knock-out that overnight paper !,1,0,2,1,3
6772,6775,) matte finish makes this fairly fingerprint  macbook layout and ports .,1,0,2,1,3
6773,6776,( great if that is a layout you )  are warnings that state that this computer is known to cause cancer and that the user should wash one 's hands after use .,1,0,2,1,3
6774,6777,"hence , this may not be the best choice for children and adolescents ( who may forget to wash their hands ) the hinges on the screen are excellent , the screen does slightly wobble as one not rated for gaming , do know that this laptop will not perform well with games like dragon age ii or witcher 3 .",1,0,2,1,3
6775,6778,"so , if you were hoping that this could be your gaming computer on the side , you might need a more a powerful told , i was truly impressed with the overall capabilities of this laptop .",1,0,2,1,3
6776,6779,"it is fantastic for travel , great for spreadsheets , perfect for watching videos , and has almost zero bloatware ( i was really pleased with that !",1,0,2,1,3
6777,6780,) recommended !,1,0,2,1,3
6778,6781,"pc laptop was shipped early , came in good shape .",2,1,2,5,7
6779,6782,everything was included as purchased .,2,1,2,5,7
6780,6783,i am using it now and it performs very fast .,2,1,2,5,7
6781,6784,i have only hp computers so i expected to get a good product .,2,1,2,5,7
6782,6785,it came with hp elite premium support ; i had a question so i called the help number - as they advertised there are no phone trees and a real english speaking person answered the phone .,2,1,2,5,7
6783,6786,"i had no hassle with him , no need to identify myself - he just started helping me .",2,1,2,5,7
6784,6787,the reason i called was because windows 10 sometimes messes up with the initial password - which defaults to a microsoft e-mail .,2,1,2,5,7
6785,6788,i had that problem and had to restart and recover the system from the backup d  drive on the system .,2,1,2,5,7
6786,6789,it restored perfectly and i was very careful in setting up the initial password to be sure that i had the correct password for the microsoft e-mail account .,2,1,2,5,7
6787,6790,everything is fine now .,2,1,2,5,7
6788,6791,the hp agent stayed with me until i knew everything was working perfectly .,2,1,2,5,7
6789,6792,"btw , the price for the laptop was very good - i did a lot of checking of other sites before i purchased from amazon .",2,1,2,5,7
6790,6793,really fast little laptop !,3,4,3,0,3
6791,6794,thanks to the ssd !,3,4,3,0,3
6792,6795,seems like a great unit have always liked dell .,3,1,3,6,3
6793,6796,"the power plug is smaller than my older units , but i expect great durability .",3,1,3,6,3
6794,6797,bought this to replace my work laptop which died after 5 years of abuse !,3,1,3,6,3
6795,6798,this is my third dell i expect it last just as long .,3,1,3,6,3
6796,6799,"has touch screen which does n't seem to sensitive , the whole thing is very lite and has storage capacity .",3,1,3,6,3
6797,6800,2 freaking terabytes !,3,1,3,6,3
6798,6801,i 've already had it grinding away for a few hours transfer a couple hundred gigs of data !,3,1,3,6,3
6799,6802,"the other reviews say its slow i have not noticed that , but dell did install alot of crap that i do n't use mostly antivirus and support programs .",3,1,3,6,3
6800,6803,great laptop at a great price !,3,1,3,6,3
6801,6804,"it is built very evident build quality is obviously other reviewers noted , it comes loaded with all kinds of bloatware , and with an old version of windows took about a day of downloading windows 10 updates before i was even allowed to see the system and hard drive , in order to verify it was the computer i ordered",3,1,3,6,3
6802,6805,then there was another day of cleaning out the .,3,1,3,6,3
6803,6806,"btw , forget it if you do not connect to the internet by cable .",3,1,3,6,3
6804,6807,"the wifi windows 10 update did not work at all.i suppose if the cost of the computer is cheaper due to the bloatware , you could make arguments that it is ok .",3,1,3,6,3
6805,6808,"but if you want to just buy a computer and use it right away , do n't get this instance , it comes with mcafee antivirus .",3,1,3,6,3
6806,6809,"it only took two days before i was getting pop ups for an expensive monthly subscription to mcafee , or `` be unprotected '' .",3,1,3,6,3
6807,6810,"it took me quite a while to figure out how to remove mcafee and start up the free windows after a lot of effort on my part , the computer is still infected with dell software , and i expect i will never quite delete all of it .",3,1,3,6,3
6808,6811,"little windows keep popping up asking me how i feel about dell service , for instance .",3,1,3,6,3
6809,6812,"it is very difficult to know which program from dell is needed for something essential like mouse support , and which one is basically dell hardware side of things is no thing re-boots itself once or twice a day for no apparent reason , and then starts up youtube and plays the last youtube video i have watched .",3,1,3,6,3
6810,6813,"so in the middle of the night youtube starts playing , and i have to unlock the screen in order to turn it it self re-boots the touch screen feature often will not function .",3,1,3,6,3
6811,6814,"a re-boot will not bring back the touch screen , but so far a complete shut down and re-start will fix it.the touch screen , when it does function , feels speed of the computer is adequate for the price .",3,1,3,6,3
6812,6815,"and the screen viewing angle is also the case and keyboard feel like a cheap disposable , i can not recommend this , but i am lost as to what else i might choose .",3,1,3,6,3
6813,6816,"from what i can see , the other manufacturers are all just as luck ! update - after 3 or so weeks .",3,1,3,6,3
6814,6817,the computer has been stable and works as it should .,3,1,3,6,3
6815,6818,the initial setup was a grind .,3,1,3,6,3
6816,6819,"but it has not re-booted itself for the last 3 weeks , and the touchscreen is functioning .",3,1,3,6,3
6817,6820,i do not work for dell but computers are my business .,3,1,3,6,3
6818,6821,this is a very good laptop for the price .,3,1,3,6,3
6819,6822,"at this price do not expect a gaming machine but expect a stable computer to surf the web , email and play some videos .",3,1,3,6,3
6820,6823,other reviewers tend to think that you should be able to play the newest games on ultra high settings for about $ 400.00 there is a reason there are still $ laptops out there .,3,1,3,6,3
6821,6824,"bought this for my brother who just started college ( 2017 ) , this is a good alternative to an expensive gaming or two in one laptop .",3,1,3,6,3
6822,6825,"it does run slow at first with updates and bloatware but once removed this is a very good deal for the amount of storage , ram etc .",3,1,3,6,3
6823,6826,"if you ’ re looking for something for gaming or anything to do with media i would suggest something else , but if you need something for writing , excel and simple computing tasks this is a great option",3,1,3,6,3
6824,6827,i was skeptical at first but this computer is amazing !,3,1,3,6,3
6825,6828,i had a prior dell inspirion and this is replacing it .,3,1,3,6,3
6826,6829,i got many good years out of that computer .,3,1,3,6,3
6827,6830,"this computer was slow at first but i automatically went and removed all the bloatware of it , now it is blazing fast !",3,1,3,6,3
6828,6831,i love the touchscreen and size of the screen .,3,1,3,6,3
6829,6832,"overall , this computer has been great !",3,1,3,6,3
6830,6833,"i hope it lasts as long as my last great job dell ! update after 3 months  can ’ t complain with it at all , it has run fantastic after disabling all the bloatware and windows 10 services !",3,1,3,6,3
6831,6834,i had given up on pc after the windows 8 nightmare .,3,1,3,6,3
6832,6835,"i ’ m about the fourth work day that was wasted trying to deal with that ridiculousness i left the office , went straight to a computer store , and bought a macbook air out of sheer rage .",3,1,3,6,3
6833,6836,never had a moment of trouble with it and swore i would never buy another pc .,3,1,3,6,3
6834,6837,"recently i hired an assistant who has never used a mac , and i didn ’ t want to spend mac money , so i bought this for her .",3,1,3,6,3
6835,6838,it ’ s been perfect so far .,3,1,3,6,3
6836,6839,"i ’ m no tech expert but i know a crappy computer when i see one , and this is not one of them .",3,1,3,6,3
6837,6840,"i was using icloud but needed to switch to because i don ’ t want my assistant in my personal photos , etc .",3,1,3,6,3
6838,6841,now i ’ m planning to buy a second one for myself since the macbook air makes it hard for me to use .,3,1,3,6,3
6839,6842,it ’ s cool that it has a touch screen too .,3,1,3,6,3
6840,6843,i didn ’ t think i would care about that but it ’ s handy every once in a while .,3,1,3,6,3
6841,6844,"after the nightmare of going thru the many updates which bogs the machine down upon unboxing i have found this laptop to be fast , efficient and solidly built .",3,1,3,6,3
6842,6845,just be patient in the first 24hrs .,3,1,3,6,3
6843,6846,and you will be rewarded with a great little laptop .,3,1,3,6,3
6844,6847,excellent .,3,1,3,6,3
6845,6848,coordinated well with iphones .,3,1,3,6,3
6846,6849,computer is ok .,3,1,3,6,3
6847,6850,feels cheap plastic but nice having a huge touchscreen and a large keyboard .,3,1,3,6,3
6848,6851,took over 9 hours to download initial windows update but for basic usage it 's going to be ok i hope .,3,1,3,6,3
6849,6852,setup was easy .,3,1,3,6,3
6850,6853,performs well right out of the box .,3,1,3,6,3
6851,6854,would like to have known if the ram was expandable .,3,1,3,6,3
6852,6855,nothing in the dell or microsoft software would tell me .,3,1,3,6,3
6853,6856,this computer was for my boyfriend and he is super happy about the size of the screen and the touchscreen capability .,3,1,3,6,3
6854,6857,he works very well .,3,1,3,6,3
6855,6858,i 'd buy again .,3,1,3,6,3
6856,6859,"works pretty well , took 5 hours to update ugh ! i also uninstalled a lot of things that made it slow from the beginning now it 's very fan is medium noise sometimes and than very only thing is skype .",3,1,3,6,3
6857,6860,i think this laptop dont take in light well.i may have to play with the camera settings .,3,1,3,6,3
6858,6861,"because in the morning with plenty light it shows very clear to the person i 'm skyping with , more detailed he at night with all the lights turned off , you can only see my face if you turn on the brightness at full power .",3,1,3,6,3
6859,6862,may have to call dell about that .,3,1,3,6,3
6860,6863,because my old laptop i could use the light from the person i 'm talking to would highlight my face very well without turning up my to hold a charge for about 4-5 hours .,3,1,3,6,3
6861,6864,also when turned off i still save light which is good and awesome that is has a touchscreen which i most likely wo n't use much because i do n't want handprints on my screen .,3,1,3,6,3
6862,6865,"the sound is very good because the speakers is actually at the bottom , but can still hear 'll update in about two weeks to make sure this laptop works i do not use this laptop for gaming .",3,1,3,6,3
6863,6866,"it 's primarily for skype and watching kdrama , anime , and other tv show  a brand new laptop i had to send it to dell for repair because the fan needed replacing .",3,1,3,6,3
6864,6867,there was a noise .,3,1,3,6,3
6865,6868,i 'm returning because i should not be sending a brand new laptop for repairs .,3,1,3,6,3
6866,6869,"it 's ok for the storage + price and features , but living in this generation , it should be a bit better , power button should have a led light at least , but this laptop looks to years ago i had an dell and was better than this one except this on has a touch screen and storage .",3,1,3,6,3
6867,6870,"keyboard feels cheap , also there are no power lights so you do n't know if it 's on or off .",3,1,3,6,3
6868,6871,good speed for the average user .,3,1,3,6,3
6869,6872,"not as much bloatware as i assumed would be on it , it actually is a good deal and works well .",3,1,3,6,3
6870,6873,easy to set up [ starts yammering upon plugging it in ] and just as easy to remove all the unnecessary junk and run faster .,3,1,3,6,3
6871,6874,happy with it overall and would recommend to others .,3,1,3,6,3
6872,6875,mid range model with high capacity hard disk it serves my purposes in an excellent recommended for the reasonable price,3,1,3,6,3
6873,6876,"it is easy to use , light , tin and handy .",3,1,3,6,3
6874,6877,i love the price with great features .,3,1,3,6,3
6875,6878,pretty nice computer .,3,1,3,6,3
6876,6879,it 's fast and confortable .,3,1,3,6,3
6877,6880,excellent laptop and hard disk capacity for the price .,3,1,3,6,3
6878,6881,i really liked how light it is,3,1,3,6,3
6879,6882,but it everything else is perfect .,3,1,3,6,3
6880,6883,the touchscreen and the bluetooth work excellent .,3,1,3,6,3
6881,6884,it 's nice and light,3,1,3,6,3
6882,6885,a 2tb laptop and perfect for streaming and gaming,3,1,3,6,3
6883,6886,i love it .,3,1,3,6,3
6884,6887,it has plenty of memory and works well for what i need .,3,1,3,6,3
6885,6888,"however , it was left on the doorstep , they did n't even knock .",3,1,3,6,3
6886,6889,"i was disappointed with that , but otherwise , it 's great !",3,1,3,6,3
6887,6890,so far so good .,3,1,3,6,3
6888,6891,i bought this model after my acer 's hard drive kept dying and eventually would n't boot .,3,1,3,6,3
6889,6892,"had all the features i wanted from a dvd drive to ethernet port , 3 usb ports ( 2 3.0 ports ) , 1 hdmi port , 1 sd card slot and touch screen ( no backlit keyboard ) .",3,1,3,6,3
6890,6893,has 8gb memory and 2t drive with more enough storage .,3,1,3,6,3
6891,6894,"speed seems okay ... not super , but it will do for what i use it for .",3,1,3,6,3
6892,6895,has some dell apps on it i have n't used and probably wo n't .,3,1,3,6,3
6893,6896,overall it seems pretty versatile with ample connectivity and storage for the price .,3,1,3,6,3
6894,6897,"ca n't judge reliability yet because i 've only had it a couple of weeks or so , but dell ranked reasonably on reliability by the various tech reviewers out there .",3,1,3,6,3
6895,6898,so far it 's working for me !,3,1,3,6,3
6896,6899,this was a christmas present for my daughter .,3,1,3,6,3
6897,6900,her first laptop was a dell she used in college .,3,1,3,6,3
6898,6901,she was thrilled to get the new upgraded computer for her power point presentations and demonstrations .,3,1,3,6,3
6899,6902,it ’ s fast enough to handle her needs,3,1,3,6,3
6900,6903,so far so good !,3,1,3,6,3
6901,6904,! i have it for a almost a week and i like the keypad,3,1,3,6,3
6902,6905,very sleek and light weight,3,1,3,6,3
6903,6906,it 's a good laptop at this price,3,1,3,6,3
6904,6907,i have been an asus user for many years and there are still two in the house - my wife 's 15.6 '' and my old 13 '' .,3,1,3,6,3
6905,6908,in my search i found that dell offered more features for dollars spent .,3,1,3,6,3
6906,6909,no issues right out of the box  ) the setup took just a few minutes .,3,1,3,6,3
6907,6910,"however , the windows 10 home updates along with a few hardware and bios update took hours .",3,1,3,6,3
6908,6911,ok ... just have some patience .,3,1,3,6,3
6909,6912,"once that was done , i ran the dell which took only a few minutes .",3,1,3,6,3
6910,6913,the keyboard has a nice feel and is responsive .,3,1,3,6,3
6911,6914,"the touchpad is n't quite as sensitive as my asus , but more than acceptable .",3,1,3,6,3
6912,6915,there were professional reviews that the touchscreen was not up to par .,3,1,3,6,3
6913,6916,i find no lack of response .,3,1,3,6,3
6914,6917,"the fan is very quiet and unit seems to be running very cool , an issue i had with my case feels a bit `` plastic '' which it is of course , and has a rough texture , which if you want to skin it , you may have an issue .",3,1,3,6,3
6915,6918,a nice feature is that you do n't have to remove the back if you need to replace the battery .,3,1,3,6,3
6916,6919,"an issue with my asus which is one reason for a new system , - batteries lasted less than a year .",3,1,3,6,3
6917,6920,not sure what life expectancy will be here - hopefully much better .,3,1,3,6,3
6918,6921,"it has a fair use time of 5 hours , which with the ability to replace the battery without removing the back is a big plus if you have need to be hours without has a more than adequate hd at 2tb , and ram at 8gb ( upgradeable ) .",3,1,3,6,3
6919,6922,"the i5 processor is not the fastest on the market , but at this price point is a great value .",3,1,3,6,3
6920,6923,"this is not a gamers system , but i understand that it can do a fair job with many games .",3,1,3,6,3
6921,6924,"keep in mind that this is a new unit , not a refurbished .",3,1,3,6,3
6922,6925,"there were a lot of refurb with less features for the same dollars and more.the seller , , has the best rating of any dell and hp laptop sellers on amazon .",3,1,3,6,3
6923,6926,"they were a few dollars more than other sellers , but their customer service before the sale was excellent .",3,1,3,6,3
6924,6927,"i contacted them 6-8 times via email with various questions which were all answered promptly and in all ... super pleased with the seller , the laptop , and  there is an issue with warranty .",3,1,3,6,3
6925,6928,the dell app installed shows that the warranty expires on even though it was n't purchased until .,3,1,3,6,3
6926,6929,called dell and they said it was an amazon issue and to contact them to make the correction .,3,1,3,6,3
6927,6930,guess what ,3,1,3,6,3
6928,6931,amazon said it was dell 's problem .,3,1,3,6,3
6929,6932,called and chatted ( both ) with dell and they said that they would not honor the one year warranty .,3,1,3,6,3
6930,6933,reason  the warranty starts when the unit leaves the warehouse since it was on a bulk purchase .,3,1,3,6,3
6931,6934,really ,3,1,3,6,3
6932,6935,"contacted the amazon seller , and they said that they would provide the 1 year warranty .",3,1,3,6,3
6933,6936,"does n't sound like a fair deal to me , but grateful for the coverage .",3,1,3,6,3
6934,6937,dell has probably lost a future customer even though this is a very nice laptop ( see review above ) .,3,1,3,6,3
6935,6938,"if there were a rating here just for dell , i would give them a one or , i contacted dell today regarding the hd being encrypted and unable to partition .",3,1,3,6,3
6936,6939,took two chats to resolve this .,3,1,3,6,3
6937,6940,no help from the first other than a phone number .,3,1,3,6,3
6938,6941,called and this tech wanted my life history before helping even though he had my system was a bit irritating and i told him i was going to hang-up and try later .,3,1,3,6,3
6939,6942,i did a chat again .,3,1,3,6,3
6940,6943,this chat tech was even willing to do a remote to help out .,3,1,3,6,3
6941,6944,i did n't have the time for that - so the email route .,3,1,3,6,3
6942,6945,i got all the information i needed and all is well .,3,1,3,6,3
6943,6946,my last laptop was a dell that ran solidly for over eight years .,3,1,3,6,3
6944,6947,i have had this one for a bit over a year and it 's been problem after problem .,3,1,3,6,3
6945,6948,i am looking at having to replace the screen entirely shortly -- the touchscreen started malfunctioning and making the computer unusable after about six months until i disabled it .,3,1,3,6,3
6946,6949,"now the screen has started flickering and if my computer falls asleep , i have to reboot it because it wakes up with a blank white screen .",3,1,3,6,3
6947,6950,"on top of everything , it 's run very slow from day one , fresh out of the box .",3,1,3,6,3
6948,6951,"it 's got a great price , but keep looking .",3,1,3,6,3
6949,6952,this is not a quality machine .,3,1,3,6,3
6950,6953,i did n't buy this from amazon but from best buy .,3,1,3,6,3
6951,6954,"first , do n't buy from dell .",3,1,3,6,3
6952,6955,"after tech support fails 3 times to fix problems , they slow walk replacement .",3,1,3,6,3
6953,6956,"this fact alone should be to the machine , eliminating bloatware is not enough .",3,1,3,6,3
6954,6957,"either touchpad andor touchscreen fail , necessitating a reboot .",3,1,3,6,3
6955,6958,windows loads slowly if you 're lucky .,3,1,3,6,3
6956,6959,sometimes you get the bsod .,3,1,3,6,3
6957,6960,"i have owned 3 dells , but this is the last .",3,1,3,6,3
6958,6961,i see no commitment to quality and inefficient unhelpful third world tech picture and sound quality is rendered black friday ,3,1,3,6,3
6959,6962,"more likely , the nightmare before xmas .",3,1,3,6,3
6960,6963,it 's a good all around machine for the money .,3,7,5,1,1
6961,6964,passmark rates my machine in the 69th percentile in performance for all computers they 've tested .,3,7,5,1,1
6962,6965,"the 12 gb memory and ssd disk speeds rate especially high , around the 75th percentile .",3,7,5,1,1
6963,6966,so booting and loading apps is blazing fast .,3,7,5,1,1
6964,6967,i just wish i knew more about cpus before i purchased .,3,7,5,1,1
6965,6968,"this uses a 7th generation i7 processor ( i-7 ) , which rates around the 50th percentile in terms of all cpus .",3,7,5,1,1
6966,6969,"quite fast for everyday use , although it rates in the bottom third of the many flavors of core i-7 processors .",3,7,5,1,1
6967,6970,but i have some spreadsheets that use computation-intensive simulations that can really benefit from a speedy cpu .,3,7,5,1,1
6968,6971,i did n't know that an 8th gen core i-5 processor like the is actually much faster for heavy computing ( i figured any i-7 cpu has to be faster than any i-5 cpu ... silly me ) .,3,7,5,1,1
6969,6972,and you can get an i-5 processor for only $ 599 in the acer aspire e15 model on this site .,3,7,5,1,1
6970,6973,"it has only 8gb ram , but it would 've been a better fit for me ... 120 % faster spreadsheet processing versus my old laptop instead of the 50 % gain this lenovo gives me .",3,7,5,1,1
6971,6974,"the passmark website ( and its free downloadable software for testing your machine ) is very good for learning about different processor speeds , graphics cards and disk drives .",3,7,5,1,1
6972,6975,live and learn .,3,7,5,1,1
6973,6976,"excellent laptop , powerful i7 core and loads of ram make this a serious laptop .",3,7,5,1,1
6974,6977,i use mine daily and have nothing but good experiences with it .,3,7,5,1,1
6975,6978,super fast booting up but not please with battery life and screen resolution .,3,7,5,1,1
6976,6979,screen not clear to view .,3,7,5,1,1
6977,6980,as advertised .,3,7,5,1,1
6978,6981,been using for two months and have no complaints .,3,7,5,1,1
6979,6982,we use lenovo computers and work stations at my job and they seemed pretty reliable which prompted this purchase for my personal use .,3,7,5,1,1
6980,6983,"it 's fast , light , huge screen , and it looks good .",3,7,5,1,1
6981,6984,very happy with this laptop .,3,0,0,5,2

6984,6987,had ms office and internet in do n't mind the keyboard at all .,3,0,0,5,2
6985,6988,no problems and sound are reason i knock off one star is that i do n't like the touch pad .,3,0,0,5,2
6986,6989,it 's either over sensitive or not sensitive enough .,3,0,0,5,2
6987,6990,"mouse will randomly slide across screen , have to hit the left and right tabs too hard .",3,0,0,5,2
6988,6991,"i ordered a mouse , and i 'm sure after that it will be perfect ! it is simple and streamlined .",3,0,0,5,2
6989,6992,probably would n't recommend for anything complex at all .,3,0,0,5,2
6990,6993,"but if you just want a low priced machine for word processing and basic internet , it 's wonderful .",3,0,0,5,2

6997,7000,finally froze with the start button lit up .,3,0,0,5,2
6998,7001,no response from any keys .,3,0,0,5,2
6999,7002,tried to return it but amazon wanted me to prepay the shipment internationally from chile .,3,0,0,5,2
7000,7003,it would cost 10 times of what dhl charge have to settle for a local repair at my cost .,3,0,0,5,2
7001,7004,and how i hate windows 10 .,3,0,0,5,2
7002,7005,"this has a very small processor , 1 ghz about third of the size of my is 3ghz .",3,0,0,5,2

7024,7027,this seems like a premium product .,3,6,2,1,7
7025,7028,the external branding is a more muted than on a lot of ‘ gaming ’ laptops and this model will not look gaudy in a classroom or office environment .,3,6,2,1,7
7026,7029,"that ’ s not the case for many competitors , which look obnoxious .",3,6,2,1,7
7027,7030,"the red screen bezel is a muted red , more like an accent , and the only really distinction will be that sweet backlit keyboard .",3,6,2,1,7

7029,7032,it ’ s a fun experience to unwrap and turn this laptop on and i can see someone really being engrossed over this by a christmas tree with unwrapped gifts nearby .,3,6,2,1,7
7030,7033,"not thirty minutes after i got this , and i ’ ve got office installed to type this review , and steam is downloading gta v for testing its real laptop has a high performance ssd hard drive , with no moving parts , leading to a perception of a very fast system because windows and your programs will load very quickly ,",3,6,2,1,7
7031,7034,"that ’ s not a problem if you just delete games you aren ’ t using , and adding another hard drive is possible .",3,6,2,1,7
7032,7035,"bear in mind that there ’ s no blu-ray or dvd drive on this laptop , which is a good i ’ d rather have the extra space ( where you can install an additional hard drive ) .",3,6,2,1,7
7033,7036,"this laptop has no moving parts aside from the keys on the keyboard , making the thing feel rock solid yet light for its size .",3,6,2,1,7
7034,7037,the angular body is the most comfortable laptop i ’ ve typed on because my wrists and the angles just seem to match comfortably as i type .,3,6,2,1,7
7035,7038,"the keyboard isn ’ t the mechanical joy of an old thinkpad , but it ’ s easy to type on with the clearly lit keys , and it ’ s quiet to type on .",3,6,2,1,7
7036,7039,"as i write this review , i ’ m typing quickly and easily .",3,6,2,1,7
7037,7040,"the touchpad is quite large and i really its subtle red frame , marking its place even in a dark room .",3,6,2,1,7
7038,7041,"i really like the way this thing feels and found wifi performance is excellent , particularly with a modern beam forming router .",3,6,2,1,7
7039,7042,"i used this laptop in a building where most wifi devices run into a lot of interference with the old steel construction , but this laptop kept working quite well .",3,6,2,1,7
7040,7043,"i recognize this is hardware overkill for office tasks , however even though i ’ ve got a few other laptops , this is the one i would take to a meeting or to type a paper .",3,6,2,1,7
7041,7044,the screen is gorgeous !,3,6,2,1,7
7042,7045,"the audio is great for a laptop and i enjoy games and movies , but at home i ’ ll still pair with my bluetooth soundbar for better let ’ s sum up things so far  the laptop is very nice to look at , with good sound , a great screen , good keyboard , great mouse , and it ’",3,6,2,1,7
7043,7046,it ’ s easy to set up and will be the gift of the year on christmas for a lot of people.the remaining matter is the raw performance .,3,6,2,1,7
7044,7047,"is this thing really going to play those games well  well , my first impression was that this laptop was a poser .",3,6,2,1,7
7045,7048,"half the vents on the laptop are fake , etched in plastic , like a fake air intake on a cheap sporty car .",3,6,2,1,7
7046,7049,there are two fundamental ways to cool a gaming laptop .,3,6,2,1,7
7047,7050,"either you run two heat paths , metal and fans and vents , one for the gpu and one for the cpu , or you run a single one .",3,6,2,1,7
7048,7051,"this laptop looks like it ’ s the superior dual path version , and i believe acer designed this case with the possibility of using that solution at a higher price point , but looking at the internals and the vents , it ’ s clear there is a single path sharing the cpu and gpu ’ s heat .",3,6,2,1,7
7049,7052,that means heat will spike and it will accumulate faster .,3,6,2,1,7
7050,7053,i ’ ll get back to this in a specs on this laptop are very similar to my desktop machine i built a couple of years ago .,3,6,2,1,7
7051,7054,"my desktop has a quad core i5 processor , slightly faster , and it has a , the equivalent last generation version of this .",3,6,2,1,7
7052,7055,"( gpu numbers can be confusing , but the 9 or 10 in these numbers is the edition , think ‘ year of a car ’ s make ’ and the 50 is the model , think ‘ honda civic ’ ) .",3,6,2,1,7
7053,7056,"this laptop has 4 gb of video memory to my desktop ’ s two , and 4 gb is great , but otherwise the two systems are very evenly matched for paper , the specs of this laptop are great for playing games .",3,6,2,1,7
7054,7057,"my desktop with very similar specs plays gta v , skyrim se , echo , and many other modern games with graphics settings set very high , and it does so reliably .",3,6,2,1,7
7055,7058,"this laptop has a slightly more modern gpu , but that generous 4gb should mean excellent performance , actually in the realm of vr expectation was that the cooling system would be overwhelmed quickly , and the laptop would either need to be set to ‘ medium ’ settings on games , or i would see a lot of framerate problems , and",3,6,2,1,7
7056,7059,"so to test this i ran the unreal “ heaven 4.0 ” benchmark on its most extreme settings on both this laptop and my desktop , in the same i was really impressed with the screen on the laptop as i ran the benchmark .",3,6,2,1,7
7057,7060,it just looks great .,3,6,2,1,7
7058,7061,"the laptop noticed the tough test quickly and the fans kicked in , making the laptop sound like a ps4 running hot .",3,6,2,1,7
7059,7062,"it topped off at about 67 degrees c ( which is about as hot as you ’ d want a chip to get to preserve its reliability ) , and my desktop topped off at about the same point .",3,6,2,1,7
7060,7063,"the systems had both reached their thermal limit and would not push harder , instead dropping performance , which is exactly how they are expectations of the laptop being crushed by my desktop ’ s performance were quickly proven wrong .",3,6,2,1,7
7061,7064,"the laptop was doing slightly better than the desktop , and continued to do so for most of the 26 benchmark tests .",3,6,2,1,7
7062,7065,"at one point , the toughest test , its framerate dropped to 9 frames per second , but on average it did a little better than the desktop .",3,6,2,1,7
7063,7066,"i ’ ve attached a screenshot of the benchmark , the bottom line is that the cooling solution isn ’ t the best design , but it is adequate for the , which is a smaller , more efficient gpu design .",3,6,2,1,7
7064,7067,"based on how fast those fans kicked in , i think if you use this laptop for gaming you should keep it clean and use a cooling pad , but its performance was rock solid , and that was a complete surprise to me after tearing down gaming laptops for reflows , to repair heat damage , and assembling dozens of gaming computers ,",3,6,2,1,7
7065,7068,"the single heat path in a gaming laptop really isn ’ t the best but it ’ s working in this laptop , and that decision absolutely made it possible to sell this laptop at such a competitive price.i played two of my favorites , typing of the dead , and grand theft auto v ( on medium to high settings ) and after",3,6,2,1,7
7066,7069,"i ’ m very tempted to get a vr headset to use with this laptop , which means i have a much stronger impression of its ability to take abuse than i did before i tested it .",3,6,2,1,7
7067,7070,but if you research the for vr you will learn it 's really the bare minimum for vr .,3,6,2,1,7
7068,7071,"just keep that in mind.i conclusion , i love using this for non-gaming tasks , like typing , it looks and feels great , and the performance is impressive .",3,6,2,1,7
7069,7072,"there are compromises , and i think they are well justified by the price .",3,6,2,1,7
7070,7073,this is a great buy if you don ’ t need the absolute top of the update  after reading the other reviews i decided to grab a spare laptop hard drive and try to install it .,3,6,2,1,7
7071,7074,"i saw that there was a bag of extra screws in the box labelled “ hdd upgrade ” i removed one long screw from the base revealing a pouch style suspension for an extra hard drive , and a typical sata cable .",3,6,2,1,7
7072,7075,"i unscrewed that , plugged in the hard drive , and put all the screws back .",3,6,2,1,7
7073,7076,the hard drive worked just fine in windows .,3,6,2,1,7
7074,7077,so it appears these laptops do ship with everything you need to add a second hard drive .,3,6,2,1,7
7075,7078,so many mixed feelings about this thing from people who say `` buy the better one '' well i did not .,3,6,2,1,7
7076,7079,i bought this because it fit my budget and man am i glad i did .,3,6,2,1,7
7077,7080,"the haters all said it wont do x or it struggles with y , well f those haters .",3,6,2,1,7
7078,7081,"this thing is smooth , looks cool , and runs like a dream .",3,6,2,1,7
7079,7082,i 've been playing league of legends mostly but i confirmed it would run and csgo with no issues .,3,6,2,1,7
7080,7083,if you do n't have the funds for a predator and just want a laptop that can game this is the one .,3,6,2,1,7
7081,7084,"not to mention , its a laptop that can game for under 1k .",3,6,2,1,7
7082,7085,i purchased this laptop for $ 750 which at this point in time is a great deal .,3,6,2,1,7
7083,7086,it came with nvidia graphics card which is good for 1080p gaming .,3,6,2,1,7
7084,7087,1050 would be a little too low in graphics power .,3,6,2,1,7
7085,7088,nvidia 1060 graphics card would be better but most laptops that carry one cost closer to $ 1000 .,3,6,2,1,7
7086,7089,once you start reaching that high in price i ’ d start looking into gaming pc ’ s because you ’ ll get more bang for your hard drive i received was a ssd 600p .,3,6,2,1,7
7087,7090,which is a pcie type ssd hard drive .,3,6,2,1,7
7088,7091,these are faster then sata based ssd hard drives which are faster then older hdd drives .,3,6,2,1,7
7089,7092,laptop starts really fast thanks to hard drive and does virus scans faster life is good .,3,6,2,1,7
7090,7093,it can supposedly go up to 8.5 hours but seems to be more like 6 hours for regular non-gaming tasks with brightness at half and wifi on .,3,6,2,1,7
7091,7094,keep in mind if you try gaming on battery it ’ ll only last about an hour or i feel like this laptop is very well balanced at this price range that doesn ’ t cut corners on any of the things i value in a laptop .,3,6,2,1,7
7092,7095,hard to find a better deal for a gaming laptop that can also double as something to get work done on .,3,6,2,1,7
7093,7096,i am very impressed with this so far .,3,6,2,1,7
7094,7097,i managed to run gta v online smoothly on this pc at `` normal '' graphics settings .,3,6,2,1,7
7095,7098,that 's pretty impressive for the price as it is a very system demanding game .,3,6,2,1,7
7096,7099,"plus , it looks pretty sleek .",3,6,2,1,7
7097,7100,the battery does n't last long if it 's not plugged in but it 's not intended to .,3,6,2,1,7
7098,7101,this pc is intended for performance which takes power .,3,6,2,1,7
7099,7102,"if you need something that is going to have a long battery life for hanging out online or doing homework , you 'll want to choose something different .",3,6,2,1,7
7100,7103,we have only had it a week so i will update with any issues that this rating to 3 stars .,3,6,2,1,7
7101,7104,after just under 2 months of use - the keyboard stopped working .,3,6,2,1,7
7102,7105,"i tried to update the driver , was up to date .",3,6,2,1,7
7103,7106,"tried to reinstall the driver , that did not repair it .",3,6,2,1,7
7104,7107,then i made the mistake of just shutting it down .,3,6,2,1,7
7105,7108,well ... the power button is on the keyboard .,3,6,2,1,7
7106,7109,"that means , once shut down , i was unable to turn it back on .",3,6,2,1,7
7107,7110,it 's now being sent in for this back to 4 stars because acer repair was very fast .,3,6,2,1,7
7108,7111,"however , they asked that i send the pc in the original packaging , but did not send it back to me in the original packaging , so now i no longer have it should anything else go wrong .",3,6,2,1,7
7109,7112,"this is an excellent laptop for gaming , basic productivity , or even some coding for a comp student .",3,6,2,1,7
7110,7113,"it has a bright , somewhat color-accurate ips display , a nicely spaced , back-lit keyboard with very quiet keys for typing , and of course the beasty combination of a 7th gen core i5 processor , a gtx 1050 ti gpu , and 8 gb of ram to keep it all humming nicely .",3,6,2,1,7
7111,7114,"this is of course considered and `` entry level '' platform for a serious pc gamer , but this is n't really for a serious pc gamer is it ",3,6,2,1,7
7112,7115,"just for reference i am coming from a lenovo ideapad with an intel processor , a gt gpu and also 8 gb of ram , and that is a really nice mid-tier gaming laptop from about 5 years back and a great machine .",3,6,2,1,7
7113,7116,"though the cheaper i5 included with this machine is still outstripped , power-wise , by my 5 year old i7 ( with hyper-threading ) the overall build of this budget acer gaming pc absolutely destroys everything else on the lenovo performance-wise .",3,6,2,1,7
7114,7117,"the newer i5 is neck and neck with the i7 , but the `` budget '' gtx 1050 ti with 4 gb of vram ( vs. the 2 gb vram ) and 256 gb ssd make a gigantic difference in how games load and do i call this `` gamer lite '' ",3,6,2,1,7
7115,7118,well because this laptop really only comes with the bare minimum required for a pc gamer .,3,6,2,1,7
7116,7119,"you only get a 256 gb ssd , and 8 gb of ram .",3,6,2,1,7
7117,7120,"the real excellent upgrade is the gtx 1050 ti gpu , which is freakin stellar for a pc priced under $ 1000 usd .",3,6,2,1,7
7118,7121,"basically , you get everything you need to run most aaa titles at high settings , on a laptop that costs $ 750 usd !",3,6,2,1,7
7119,7122,256 gb is n't gon na give you a lot of space for a huge library ( obviously ) but the fact that it is solid state makes it so quick .,3,6,2,1,7
7120,7123,win 10 boots in seconds .,3,6,2,1,7
7121,7124,steam opens literally instantly .,3,6,2,1,7
7122,7125,instantly !,3,6,2,1,7
7123,7126,not exaggerating .,3,6,2,1,7
7124,7127,"kiss those long load times did a lot of research before i decided on this laptop , and there are a few reviewers ( youtube and website reviews ) out there talking a lot about heat .",3,6,2,1,7
7125,7128,"it is true , this particular laptop does n't have the best design for cooling , but it is totally fine for normal use .",3,6,2,1,7
7126,7129,"i mean if you want to run a aaa title on ultra settings for several hours then yeah , your cpu and gpu are gon na get hot and start to degrade .",3,6,2,1,7
7127,7130,but this thing is n't for that .,3,6,2,1,7
7128,7131,that 's what a maxed out gaming tower with 10 fans and liquid cooling is for .,3,6,2,1,7
7129,7132,go buy that if that 's what you want to do .,3,6,2,1,7
7130,7133,i 've seen external heat tests on this thing that look totally in line with what you would want from a performance laptop .,3,6,2,1,7
7131,7134,"if it gets hot then that means its time to go outside and talk to people , great value for an excellent setup .",3,6,2,1,7
7132,7135,not the best .,3,6,2,1,7
7133,7136,not even by far the worst .,3,6,2,1,7
7134,7137,at this price point your options are quite limited but this is really the best bang for your buck .,3,6,2,1,7
7135,7138,"and also , pretty nice to use just as a pc .",3,6,2,1,7
7136,7139,"for the money , i 'm satisfied my purchase .",3,6,2,1,7
7137,7140,i bought it to be used as a remote work pc for software development ( apps ) and for occasional  colors and black levels are great .,3,6,2,1,7
7138,7141,"its max brightness is probably too dim for the laptop to be used outdoors , if that 's important to  nice to type on .",3,6,2,1,7
7139,7142,"i still prefer `` full keyboard '' laptops like alienware and old dell laptops , but i can type quickly on this and it 's comfortable  it 's pretty much always warm , regardless of what you 're doing .",3,6,2,1,7
7140,7143,the upside is that 's true when gaming ; it does n't get extremely  it does n't feel heavy in my lap and it 's well balanced .,3,6,2,1,7
7141,7144,it 's very easy to open and close the screen one-handed .,3,6,2,1,7
7142,7145,good build  ok .,3,6,2,1,7
7143,7146,"so long as the gpu is off , it seems to have a battery ( of actual use ) .",3,6,2,1,7
7144,7147,"since this is a gaming pc , i feel that 's  witcher 3 runs at consistently 1600x900 and high graphics ( hair works off ) and looks great !",3,6,2,1,7
7145,7148,"2 `` feels '' like it runs @ 60fps with 1080p and high graphics , but i have n't ran it with fraps to be sure .",3,6,2,1,7
7146,7149,overwatch is an unwavering 60fps at high upgrades  there is an extra hard-drive access panel and an access panel for ( i assume ) ram .,3,6,2,1,7
7147,7150,"i opened the hard-drive panel , saw there was a cable and mounting hardware for an extra drive , so i connected a 256gb ssd i had from a prior laptop .",3,6,2,1,7
7148,7151,"i restarted the laptop , windows 10 detected the drive , and i was able to format it in seconds .",3,6,2,1,7
7149,7152,i 'll probably add a second 8gb stick of ram as a future upgrade .,3,6,2,1,7

7151,7154,"after a week of playing around and testing various aspects of this laptop , i 've come to the conclusion that while this does seem to be the best bang for the buck of convertible laptops out right now , it 's really just that .",3,6,2,1,7
7152,7155,"bang for buck , as opposed to best performance .",3,6,2,1,7
7153,7156,"i 'll be evaluating this from 3 perspectives , the average laptop user [ which this was not made for ] , the artist , and the average user - 910 laptop is something else to look at .",3,6,2,1,7
7154,7157,"i 'm not a fan of the black and red color scheme personally , but the shinny red hinges and bezel along the bottom of the laptop provide an uncommon aesthetic that while may not be the most business friendly , does n't impose much on others either , and definitely is nice to look at from a personal setting .",3,6,2,1,7
7155,7158,"the aluminum chassis is very sleek looking , but is a finger print magnet .",3,6,2,1,7
7156,7159,"the whole device is , and i say this with caution towards the industry , `` thin and light '' enough to fit comfortably in my backpack without any real added heft .",3,6,2,1,7
7157,7160,"bootup on the ssd is fast , and the whole os maneuvering is snappy , and there 's plenty of space for everything not in program files on the hdd .",3,6,2,1,7
7158,7161,8 gbs of ram is more than enough for any everyday use scenario .,3,6,2,1,7
7159,7162,"the screen is more than adequate , in my opinion .",3,6,2,1,7
7160,7163,"it 's not super bright , but bright enough to be used in a fully lit room [ though outside , the sun is a bit too much for this to handle , due to gloss glare ] .",3,6,2,1,7
7161,7164,"it has very wide viewing angles , and due to that and what seemed like more color distinction over my last device [ lenovo flex 3 ] , i confused it for an ips display [ apparently it 's not ] .",3,6,2,1,7
7162,7165,"touch input is good for everyday maneuvering , being fairly accurate and fast [ more on this in the art section ] .",3,6,2,1,7

7164,7167,"it has a red backlight , which is nice and bright enough , however , acer has a 30 second timeout on the backlight , which can not be disabled , and is very offputting and uncomfortable when using the laptop in a dark room , as i 've now developed the habit of quickly hitting ctrl before typing in order to turn on",3,6,2,1,7
7165,7168,"i would appreciate an acer update to fix this , but apparently so would the rest of acer 's community .",3,6,2,1,7
7166,7169,"trackpad is good , nothing to complain about , but an interesting thing worth mentioning is that it seems to have variable click sensitivity on the left and right click buttons .",3,6,2,1,7

7173,7176,"as a tablet ( mode ) , the laptop is rather big and heavy at about 5 lbs , so it 's not something you 'd want to be standing with for a long time , but if sitting in a chair or in bed , works fine for extended use .",3,6,2,1,7

7186,7189,"you can still create art on it , and the more i do on the device , the more i adapt to it , but it 's not as intuitive of an experience as i think it should the gamer - 810 is honestly not a great price to performance gaming machine , but to be fair , it 's meant to",3,6,2,1,7
7187,7190,"8 gb of ram , while not always suitable for gaming and multitasking , was fine for anything i tested this device with , so long as i did n't leave my 30 chrome tabs open haha ... ahem .",3,6,2,1,7
7188,7191,"the gtx 1050 , with 2 extra gigs of vram dedicated to it works wonders on most things at 1080p ; medium to max settings are enjoyable to playable on seemingly anything .",3,6,2,1,7
7189,7192,the on the other hand ... both does and does n't work that same magic .,3,6,2,1,7
7190,7193,i should say it works like a dream for the first 30-90 seconds of gaming ... and then becomes a potato .,3,6,2,1,7
7191,7194,"the cpu is very capable , but is hindered by temperatures and power draw limits .",3,6,2,1,7
7192,7195,"it will begin a game running at the max 3.4 ghz on all 4 cores , destroying the framerates [ fps ] of any game i 'd tried [ which is admittedly not that many in one week , but they were two more demanding ones of dark souls 3 [ many settings tested ] and final fantasy xv [ 1080p average ]",3,6,2,1,7
7193,7196,"however , after the aforementioned 30-90 second turbo limit , on stock settings , the cpu throttles down to about 1.1 ghz , sometimes less , causing framerates to plummet into the unplayable territory , as if you had gone from a pseudo i7 , which is what this is , to an atom or celeron .",3,6,2,1,7
7194,7197,"on these stock settings , temperatures were around 40-50 c idle , and averaged around 68-70 c under load .",3,6,2,1,7
7195,7198,"after using intel to undervolt -100 mv , interestingly , temperatures went up a few degrees , at 70-75 c under load , but performance increased by almost 500 mhz , to averages of ghz under load .",3,6,2,1,7
7196,7199,"which still is n't great , but is better , keeping games in the fps territory .",3,6,2,1,7
7197,7200,"however , acer has placed a power draw limit on the cpu for when the gpu is active simultaneously .",3,6,2,1,7
7198,7201,"while on short turbo boosts , or when only putting the cpu under load , the cpu will draw about 25 w of power to reach 3.4 ghz across all cores , stably , and at around or just below the same temps .",3,6,2,1,7
7199,7202,"but while the gpu is running alongside it , it will only draw a max of 10 w , which is less than the power draw it 's even rated for [ 15 w ] .",3,6,2,1,7
7200,7203,"this is ridiculous , because i 've observed more temporary performance with no increased heat , and i have n't found a solution to it , but perhaps it 's still more to do with thermals and means that the pu 's could do with some thermal paste reapplication .",3,6,2,1,7
7201,7204,"however , i do n't know acer 's warranty policy on this , so i 'm avoiding it for the time being .",3,6,2,1,7
7202,7205,"one interesting thing to note , however , is during my test , which was hours long , performance at 1080p average settings started off in the more `` just over playable '' area of 35-45 fps , but after the laptop had been running for hours , getting uncomfortably hot to the touch all over [ i was using a controller",3,6,2,1,7
7203,7206,"still , needing to run something for hours to let the system heat up in order to get good performance is n't a valid [ or really sensical ] solution to an easily remediable problem .",3,6,2,1,7
7204,7207,"dark souls 3 had pretty jumpy numbers , still displaying great performance on high 1080p during turbo , but the most consistent long term playability [ 40-60 fps ] i found was medium-high settings on - 810 is far from a perfect device .",3,6,2,1,7
7205,7208,"it has its fair share of issues in every area , the most notable of which are cooling , keyboard lighting , and touch input , but it 's made for a niche of people who need a device that can do a bit of everything .",3,6,2,1,7
7206,7209,"it 's a good deal for the money compared to the ( mostly lenovo ) competition , getting you a gaming and art capable machine with a powerful and an combo , and [ not offered by the spin 5 models , or by many other ] .",3,6,2,1,7
7207,7210,"it gets a grade , but still has a lot of room for improvement in future models .",3,6,2,1,7
7208,7211,general overall review before in depth  graphics card at a cheap processor will get everything you need done with a ssd over a standard resolution to watch full hd keyboard to operate in the too a nice exterior distributes heat well and fans keep it expand hard drive storage with hdd or,3,6,2,1,7
7209,7212,and for the price i paid i 'm thoroughly impressed .,3,6,2,1,7
7210,7213,this computer performs like that of a $ $ 1000 computer .,3,6,2,1,7
7211,7214,"has enough ram to execute all your programs , 1080p screen , a decent i5 processor and a pretty powerful graphics card for the price .",3,6,2,1,7
7212,7215,everyone always worries about needing an i7 processor for gaming but in reality if your graphics card is insufficient in this it 's not then your processor wo n't give you any added benefit .,3,6,2,1,7
7213,7216,what people do n't realize is a i5 is more than sufficient in almost all cases to game if you have a good graphics card .,3,6,2,1,7
7214,7217,in comparison to my i7 lenovo there 's really not much difference in performance rather the difference lies in the graphics card .,3,6,2,1,7
7215,7218,about 4 years ago i paid $ 1100 for my lenovo which had a nvidia gtx 860m and a i7 processor and i was looking for a cheap replacement for my laptop since it broke .,3,6,2,1,7
7216,7219,but i was not really expecting much from the graphics card area especially at this low of a price .,3,6,2,1,7
7217,7220,but surprisingly not only does it perform just as well it performs much better ( new graphic card architecture and technology ) for almost half the cost .,3,6,2,1,7
7218,7221,at the time the 860m was a mid range graphics card for laptops .,3,6,2,1,7
7219,7222,but back then the laptop version of graphics card ( m ) was not on par with it 's desktop counterpart and in most cases only performed about 40-70 % of what it 's counterpart could do .,3,6,2,1,7
7220,7223,but now with the new architecture and technology the laptop counterpart performs at 75-90 % of it 's desktop counterpart and actually is almost identical in performance since it 's pretty much the same except for a few other tweaks but i digress .,3,6,2,1,7
7221,7224,so the nvidia gtx although a mid range chip performs so much better than mid range chips back in the day and especially for a laptop it packs a punch .,3,6,2,1,7
7222,7225,make sure when you get your laptop that it 's the 1050 ti version and not just the plain 1050 .,3,6,2,1,7
7223,7226,the ti version packs a bit more of a punch which does make a difference .,3,6,2,1,7
7224,7227,because some people have complained and rated the computer poorly because they received a 1050 version and not the only complaint is the plastic material in which it 's made of vs the metal finish of my previous laptop .,3,6,2,1,7
7225,7228,the plastic makes it feel cheap ( well it is ) but obviously it 's more of an aesthetics thing than performance .,3,6,2,1,7
7226,7229,and some complain about the hard drive space being insufficient .,3,6,2,1,7
7227,7230,"to be honest if you 're using this computer for standard work the space will be more than sufficient enough for you , but if you game then it will run out fast but for the price you 're paying it 's quite a steal .",3,6,2,1,7
7228,7231,sure it 's not a 1tb hard drive but it 's a ssd which will increase the overall speed and performance of your computers load and boot times but also your games and overall ssds are better for gaming .,3,6,2,1,7
7229,7232,and there 's an extra hard drive slot so you can always expand the hard drive manually either with a standard hdd if you 're on a budget and need extra space or a 2.5 m sata ii ssd if you want extra space with the continued faster performance .,3,6,2,1,7
7230,7233,but you have to call acer once you receive the product to get the hdd kit to add the extra storage .,3,6,2,1,7
7231,7234,aside from that the only other con is it can be loud when playing graphic heavy games but if you 're alone and you have headphones on it wo n't bother you much .,3,6,2,1,7
7232,7235,the fans although loud does keep the laptop cool despite the the computer is a great purchase .,3,6,2,1,7
7233,7236,powerhouse performance for under $ 1000 .,3,6,2,1,7
7234,7237,only difference between this laptop and others in the $ 1000 range is the hard drive space and sometimes the processor .,3,6,2,1,7
7235,7238,as i said before the i5 processor is more than enough and you can manually add an extra hdd or ssd ( just remember to call acer to get the kit to expand storage it 's free of charge ) so technically there 's not much difference maybe only in the material its made of .,3,6,2,1,7
7236,7239,"pros , good keyboard & trackpad , decent screen , good for almost all games playing on high to meduim settings with 60 fps .",3,6,2,1,7
7237,7240,"cons , thermals are good for older games but without a cooling pad it runs at 70 degrees c & could overheat when playing for a long time though i have n't had any issues .",3,6,2,1,7
7238,7241,overall this laptop is very good .,3,6,2,1,7
7239,7242,"i have n't played a ton of games but what i have & seen is running things like overwatch & minecraft & some other games it runs good at high settings but starts to dull down when running at ultra but still runs well , minecraft though runs at fully maxed settings with max draw distance with 100 fps .",3,6,2,1,7
